        <p>With over 20 years of experience, I've been deeply involved in website development and maintenance. I've released hundreds of plugins and themes for both WordPress and WooCommerce and am a core contributor to both.</p>
        <p>Throughout my life, I've handled thousands of freelance projects, refining my skills as an experienced web developer and delivering excellent results to clients.</p>
        <p>Currently, I work full-time at a WordPress maintenance and digital marketing company, further engaging in the WordPress community and ensuring that the web is just a little bit better because of it.</p>

        <p>I am committed to continuously improving myself and the websites I encounter. My focus lies in writing clean and secure code, while also addressing any existing vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>Contributing to bug bounties is a genuine passion of mine, as I enjoy searching through code for potential issues and applying patches to resolve them. I've currently got <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/researchers/robert-devore" target="_blank">over a dozen CVE's</a> under my belt, with seven more validated and waiting on publid disclosure.</p>
        <p>Staying up-to-date with the latest web security practices, I proactively address potential weaknesses through thorough audits and vulnerability assessments.</p>
