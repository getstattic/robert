<p>90 days until Christmas ðŸ™Œ
What are you doing to make the most of the time left?
I'm going full time at <a href="https://twitter.com/WPDispensary?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WPDispensary</a> starting today ðŸ’ªðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯
-- Robert DeVore (@deviorobert) <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert/status/912642836759236608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2017</a>
I'm officially taking the dive to start putting 100% of my waking efforts into the WP Dispensary menu management plugin.
For those of you who may not be aware of <a href="http://robertdevore.com/wp-dispensary/">WP Dispensary</a> yet, its a WordPress marijuana menu plugin I built back in November 2015.
When I first built it, it was just an idea with not much behind it. I actually cringe looking back at version 1.0 of the plugin.
BUTTTTTTTTT â€¦. in the last two years I've built an accompanying <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/cannabiz">theme</a> for it, <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/dispensary-age-verification/">a</a> <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/dispensary-coupons-wordpress-plugin/">couple</a> of free add-on's and 6 commercial <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/add-ons">extensions</a>, and pushed over a dozen new updates to the <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dispensary">WP Dispensary</a> plugin itself.
It's come a long way since it's humble <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/welcome-to-wp-dispensary/">beginnings</a> as a side project that had no real direction in the beginning.
In the beginning of 2017, I made it a point to begin to <a href="http://robertdevore.com/hello-2017/">do less, better</a>.
This is just the next step in that process.</p>

<h2>Taking the plunge</h2>
<p>To be completely honest, I'm scared as fuck to be betting my entire life on the future of the WP Dispensary plugin.
But I'm also hella excited about it ?
Never in my life have I actually been this excited to see what will happen over the next few months.
Until now, I haven't even thought about the future since I've been so focused on the present moments and the drama they've been filled with.
Over the last couple of years I've been through a lot of ups and downs, and I feel like the forward progress that WPD has made over the last couple of months is showing me where I need to place my efforts.
Those efforts will (hopefully) pay off in the long run - and keep me floating in the short term.
Especially since the business isn't making full time income yet, but the earnings are close enough that I feel working part-time on it is counter productive to it's growth.</p>
<h2>Will it work?</h2>
<p>God damn right it will, because I'm going to make it work!
Anyone who knows me knows that when I set my mind to something, I get it and this will be no different.
At this point, it's fuck everything else except WP Dispensary and it's growth.
Growth <strong>that will</strong> hit 7+ figures like other developers I've been following (? <a href="https://twitter.com/scottbolinger">@ScottBolinger</a>).
I've been freelancing and working on other things for long enough.
Now is the time for laser-like <a href="http://robertdevore.com/focus/">focus</a> and determination to turn WPD into a business that can employ other people besides just myself <em>and</em> help thousands of businesses around the world.
I've already seen WPD being used on websites across the United States and it's even being used in Canada, Mexico, France and many other countries.
To me, those are big enough wins to propel me into the next phase of my life - turning WP Dispensary into a multi-million dollar business.</p>
