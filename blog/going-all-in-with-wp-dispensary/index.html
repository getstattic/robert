<p>&mdash; Robert DeVore (@deviorobert) <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert/status/912642836759236608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I&#8217;m officially taking the dive to start putting 100% of my waking efforts into the WP Dispensary menu management plugin.</p>
<p>For those of you who may not be aware of <a href="http://robertdevore.com/wp-dispensary/">WP Dispensary</a> yet, its a WordPress marijuana menu plugin I built back in November 2015.</p>
<p>When I first built it, it was just an idea with not much behind it. I actually cringe looking back at version 1.0 of the plugin.</p>
<p>BUTTTTTTTTT &#8230;. in the last two years I&#8217;ve built an accompanying <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/cannabiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">theme</a> for it, <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/dispensary-age-verification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a</a> <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/dispensary-coupons-wordpress-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple</a> of free add-on&#8217;s and 6 commercial <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/add-ons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extensions</a>, and pushed over a dozen new updates to the <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dispensary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WP Dispensary</a> plugin itself.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s come a long way since it&#8217;s humble <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/welcome-to-wp-dispensary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beginnings</a> as a side project that had no real direction in the beginning.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2017, I made it a point to begin to <a href="http://robertdevore.com/hello-2017/">do less, better</a>.</p>
<p>This is just the next step in that process.</p>
<h2>Taking the plunge</h2>
<p>To be completely honest, I&#8217;m scared as fuck to be betting my entire life on the future of the WP Dispensary plugin.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m also hella excited about itÂ ?</p>
<p>Never in my life have I actually been this excited to see what will happen over the next few months.</p>
<p>Until now, I haven&#8217;t even thought about the future since I&#8217;ve been so focused on the present moments and the drama they&#8217;ve been filled with.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years I&#8217;ve been through a lot of ups and downs, and I feel like the forward progress that WPD has made over the last couple of months is showing me where I need to place my efforts.</p>
<p>Those efforts will (hopefully) pay off in the long run &#8211; and keep me floating in the short term.</p>
<p>Especially since the business isn&#8217;t making full time income yet, but the earnings are close enough that I feel working part-time on it is counter productive to it&#8217;s growth.</p>
<h2>Will it work?</h2>
<p>God damn right it will, because I&#8217;m going to make it work!</p>
<p>Anyone who knows me knows that when I set my mind to something, I get it and this will be no different.</p>
<p>At this point, it&#8217;s fuck everything else except WP Dispensary and it&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>Growth <strong>that will</strong>Â hit 7+ figures like other developers I&#8217;ve been following (? <a href="https://twitter.com/scottbolinger">@ScottBolinger</a>).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been freelancing and working on other things for long enough.</p>
<p>Now is the time for laser-like <a href="http://robertdevore.com/focus/">focus</a> and determination to turn WPD into a business that can employ other people besides just myself <em>and</em> help thousands of businesses around the world.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already seen WPD being used on websites across the United States and it&#8217;s even being used in Canada, Mexico, France and many other countries.</p>
<p>To me, those are big enough wins to propel me into the next phase of my life &#8211; turning WP Dispensary into a multi-million dollar business.</p>
