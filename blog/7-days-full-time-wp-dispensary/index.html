        <p>There&#8217;s now been 7 days in the books for me working full time on WP Dispensary and I want to take a little bit of time to talk about what I&#8217;ve been up to.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s been done</h2>
<p>I made it a point to put some solid hours in this week and I feel like I accomplished a good amount in the time I spent working.</p>
<p><strong>I published 3 blog posts.</strong></p>
<p>In the first seven days, I wrote three blog posts; two were published on the WP Dispensary blog.</p>
<p>One was a post about the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/cannabiz-version-1-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> of version 1.7 of the CannaBiz WordPress theme. The other was an <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/new-developer-resource-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outline</a> of the new <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/for-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Developer Resource Center</a>.</p>
<p>The third post was published here on my personal blog, discussing my jump into <a href="http://robertdevore.com/going-all-in-with-wp-dispensary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full time work</a> with <a href="http://robertdevore.com/wp-dispensary/">WP Dispensary</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/for-dispensaries/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-955" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/for-dispensaries-1024x540.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="443" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Built two new pages for <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/for-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers</a> and <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/for-dispensaries/">dispensaries</a>.</strong></p>
<p>One of the larger objectives going full time with WP Dispensary was to put together content that was specific for both dispensary owners and freelance WordPress developers.</p>
<p>There is a 50/50 split with buyers, so I know that writing content to outline how WPD can help you specifically is an important next step.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s exactly what I did.</p>
<p>The pages are largely the same as far as what they outline &#8211; the WP Dispensary plugin, it&#8217;s theme theme and add-on&#8217;s.</p>
<p>But each page has it&#8217;s own CTA specific to each visitor profile.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the Developer Resource Center, you&#8217;ll get a CTA at the bottom of the page for the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/all-in-one-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All-in-one Bundle</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/for-developers"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-956" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/code-snippets-screenshot-1024x581.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="477" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on the Getting Started page for dispensaries, you&#8217;ll get a CTA at the bottom of the page for the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/all-in-one-bundle/#setup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Setup Service</a>, which includes everything WPD has to offer and it&#8217;s all set up for you.</p>
<p><strong>Released CannaBiz 1.7</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m working hard to make sure CannaBiz is the #1 <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/cannabiz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress marijuana theme</a> online.</p>
<p>This release is part of my continued support for this mission.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/cannabiz-version-1-7/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-957" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cannabiz-theme-woocommerce-shop-layout-1024x367.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="301" /></a></p>
<p>Included are style updates for WooCommerce (default Shop page layout &amp; sidebar widgets), added support or the new <code>vendor</code> taxonomy in WP Dispensary and a few smaller fixes.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/cannabiz-version-1-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release notes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Released Age Verification 1.5</strong></p>
<p>There was a <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-logo-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bug</a> reported where the logo you upload through the <code>Customizer</code> in WordPress wasn&#8217;t displaying in the pop up.</p>
<p>This release fixes that issue. Now when you add your logo to the <code>Age Verification</code> section of your <code>Customizer</code>, it will display live on your site in the pop up.</p>
<p><strong>Released Inventory Management 1.3</strong></p>
<p>With this release, the available inventory is now hidden from <code>Details</code> table by default, with a checkbox to allow you to display it on the front end.</p>
<p>Concentrates inventory also got an update to include options for both grams and units, since WP Dispensary&#8217;s pricing structure was updated in <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/wp-dispensary-version-1-9-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 1.9.6</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Logo reformatting</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on the Brand Assets page for WP Dispensary and while doing that, I&#8217;ve finally given the logo a proper creation in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
<p>For the past two years, the website and graphics used to promote WPD have been a simple logo creation in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-437" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/wpdispensary-logo-updated.png" alt="" width="1612" height="213" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s about time that the brand itself gets a face-lift and the logo redesign is part of that process.</p>
<p>The new logo isn&#8217;t being placed anywhere live yet, since I&#8217;m working on the entire re-brand and brand guidelines.</p>
<p>Regardless, I&#8217;m happy I finally have it together and this upcoming week I&#8217;ll be pushing to have the Brand Assets page live.</p>
<h2>Started working on&#8230;</h2>
<p>Some things take time, so I started this first week off knowing that I could get the jump on a lot of the larger updates I&#8217;m working on.</p>
<p>This way, nothing I&#8217;m working on is stagnant for too long.</p>
<p>I built the main structure of the new Showcase page that I want up on WP Dispensary.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of cool places using something I built and I want to be able to show that off ?</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I have also started to build the new Brand Assets page.</p>
<p>It will have guidelines on how to use the WPD logo&#8217;s, promotional graphics you can use, etc.</p>
<p>The Brand Assets page is also another item I would like to get finalized in week 2 with WPD.</p>
<p>The newly released <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Styles</a> add-on has also had work started on it&#8217;s version 1.1 release, plus work has begun on the new POS add-on that I signed an integrator contract for this week.</p>
<h2>Overall, I&#8217;m feeling&#8230;</h2>
<p>Happy as fuck.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/happy-as-fuck.gif" alt="" width="400" height="225" /></p>
<p>It was a long week, but highly enjoyable.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the rest of this 90 day grind to see where everything ends up!</p>
<p>Thanks for following along.</p>
<p>I hope you go build something great today too ??</p>
