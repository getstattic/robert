        <p>The last time I was this excited to announce a new baby, it was my son ¬†üòÇ</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;d like to formally introduce you to <a href="https://intelli.press" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IntelliPress</a>, an AI WordPress plugin that integrates with the <a href="https://openai.com/product" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI API</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s built to help you write content faster, optimize it for search engines, generate featured images from <a href="https://pexels.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pexels</a>, and more.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a> hit the scene and changed everything.</em></p>

<p>But then just like the internet always does, it quickly made ChatGPT (the web app) look ancient.</p>

<p>The types of apps I saw people build on top of the OpenAI API caused me to spiral into a week-long brainstorming session where I listed all of the ways I could think of to integrate AI with WordPress.</p>

<p><strong>IntelliPress</strong> made the most sense and gave me the Ah-ha moment I knew I needed before deciding to jump head-first into a new project.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WordPress + AI = üòç</h2>

<p>Some text here about the blending of the two, and how it&#8217;s only getting bigger over time</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Idea: aka &#8220;I wonder if&#8221; &#8230;</h2>

<p>Picture it, a middle-aged developer sitting on the couch with his laptop after his wife and (almost) 3-year-old finally fell asleep.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s tired, and his brain just so happens to bounce around to a million different things when he&#8217;s tired.</p>

<p>Lucky for him, because on this fateful night, the exhausted web developer had a brilliant idea üí°</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/sdWoxxy83t">pic.twitter.com/sdWoxxy83t</a></p>&mdash; Robert DeVore (@deviorobert) <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert/status/1656120430581694464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>When you look at the Twitter thread, you&#8217;ll see I was up until after 4am that night.</p>

<p><em>I was genuinely inspired.</em></p>

<p>It&#8217;s the first time in years that I&#8217;ve had that feeling. </p>

<p>The last time was when I launched <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WP Dispensary</a> in 2015 (more on that another day).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The next two weeks were a blur</h2>

<p>What followed was 2 weeks of extremely late nights, mixed with more than a few sleepless nights.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been excited to wake up and return to work after passing out from exhaustion at 4 am.</p>

<p>And since I was building a brand new product, it was only right that I would dogfood it while building the IntelliPress website üòé</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve made some small tweaks to the content, but in order to get the site launched as quickly as possible, I used IntelliPress to write its own content &#8230; ALL OF IT.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="498" height="280" src="/images/robot-waving.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-8654"/></figure>

<p>The home page, about page, documentation, and support pages were all written by AI.</p>

<p>Some text is more noticeable than others, which could be because of trying different prompts and editing on the fly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve made small edits myself and will continue to alter the content until I&#8217;m happy with it.</p>

<p><strong>Human + AI = ‚ù§Ô∏è</strong></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s under the hood?</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s break down the different features of the IntelliPress plugin.</p>

<p>This will be a high-level overview since I have a more detailed post coming about the technical side of what&#8217;s being done (with code examples üî•)</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Generate content seamlessly in Gutenberg</h3>

<p>The main goal I had when building IntelliPress was to make it work directly within the Gutenberg editor, and not simply add a chat box modal.</p>

<p>The result is the Content Generator block, which comes with a few built-in options and a topic field for you to generate content that gets published directly within the Gutenberg editor üî•</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="IntelliPress AI: Generator Block Example" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kjo5oqsifcs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

</figure>

<p>Filters are included for each of the settings in the generator, so you can alter it to include different options for yourself or client websites.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Optimize SEO with Yoast</h3>

<p>Once you have your content generated, or even if you&#8217;ve written every word by hand, the next step in the publishing process is SEO optimization.</p>

<p>IntelliPress has you covered üëÄ</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="IntelliPress - SEO generator - v1.1.0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N792BfXJenw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

</figure>

<p>Now with the click of a button, you can have AI analyze your content and then generate a focus keyword, title, and description which automatically populates the Yoast SEO plugin.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Analyze Your Content and Generate Categories</h2>

<p>Similar to how the AI analyzes your content for SEO, it will also do it to intelligently categorize your content.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" style="margin-top:0;margin-right:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="IntelliPress - Categories generator - v1.1.0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tbYDKBJQRlg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

</figure>

<p>In ~7 seconds, you can have your content categorized, allowing you to move on to other tasks you have more passion for.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Generate featured images instantly with Pexels integration</h2>

<p>The next thing I knew I wanted IntelliPress to help with was setting a featured image programmatically.</p>

<p>I know there&#8217;s Dalle-2 that can be used from OpenAI but for the initial release, I wanted something that offered real photos before branching out to more creative solutions.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="IntelliPress - Image generator - v1.1.0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pt3YqLJXSSE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

</figure>

<p>You can add your Pexels API key in the IntelliPress settings. Then when you click the &#8220;Generate Image&#8221; button, it analyzes your content, gets a relevant search term, and then randomizes a result from the Pexels API.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Summarize your content with the TLDR block</h3>

<p>Last but not least is the AI-generated summary that you can include in your content before publishing.</p>

<p>Do you write a lot of content and want to give people a high-level overview of what&#8217;s in the content?</p>

<p>Now you can, with the help of artificial intelligence ü§ñ</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="IntelliPress AI: TLDR Block Example" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jsYeNAZmG1g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

</figure>

<p>As you can see, the integration with Gutenberg lets you take the content generated and turn it into something even more eye-catching.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Try out IntelliPress today</h2>
