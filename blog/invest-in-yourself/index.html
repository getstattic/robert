            <p>When it comes to building something that you want to turn into a business and earn a living from, there&#8217;s a lot of paths to success.</p>
<p>Sometimes you go viral because one specific person tweeted you. Other times there&#8217;s 3-4 years of hard work behind the scenes before a coordinated launch effort.</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;re the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/garyvee" target="_blank">guy</a> who spent 18 months doing daily videos about wine before you got your breakthrough moment.</p>
<p>Your path is going to be different than everyone before you and everyone after you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the beauty of building a business. Nobody else is going to do it like you can do it.</p>
<p>Be uniquely you, and never stop improving yourself and your position.</p>
<p>Investing in yourself is the most important investment you&#8217;ll ever make, and investing the right amount of time, energy and money can be the difference between a failed business and an absolute success.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Cash Investments</h2>
<p>Investing your own cash is one of the most common ways that people tell you to invest in yourself or your business. Sure, there&#8217;s a lot of great things that can come from a lot of funding being pushed through your business.</p>
<p>However, I believe that too much cash investment becomes a crutch to <em>build something profitable</em> instead of trying to <em>build something useful</em>.</p>
<p>It takes your eyes off the end goal, and focuses a lot of attention on how to recoup your cash investment.</p>
<p>However, there are some easy ways to invest cash in your business without letting yourself become dependent on it for your survival.</p>
<h3>Business necessities</h3>
<p>You build for the web, right? Then you&#8217;re going to need to invest in the following, at the very least:</p>
<ol>
<li>Domain name</li>
<li>Hosting account</li>
<li>Social media accounts</li>
</ol>
<p>The above cash investment will cost you anywhere from $20+ depending on what <a href="http://www.wpsitecare.com/performance-of-7-top-wordpress-hosting-companies-compared/" target="_blank">hosting provider</a> you go with and what domain name you choose.</p>
<p>These are the bare minimum needs for an online business.</p>
<p>At this point, you can hustle your way into some cash which you can then flip and invest in the other necessities that come with running a business.</p>
<p>Depending on your business and what your ultimate goals are, you&#8217;ll also need to make sure you&#8217;ve got <a href="https://piwik.org/" target="_blank">analytics</a> set up, a couple <a href="https://www.woopra.com/blog/2014/01/23/the-7-best-marketing-automation-tools/" target="_blank">marketing automation tools</a>, a DBA or LLC, an accountant (or <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/best-accounting-software/" target="_blank">accounting software</a>), marketing materials like <a href="https://www.moo.com/us/products/business-cards.html" target="_blank">business cards</a>, and the list goes on and on.</p>
<h3>Business extras</h3>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got some of the basics out of the way, what about investing in some of the cooler items as a business owner?</p>
<p>How about your own t-shirts branded with your logo? Maybe you&#8217;re wanting to attend a conference and have your own booth to interact with people at? You might also want to wrap your entire car in your logo like the <a href="/images/kush-gods1.webp" target="_blank">Kush Gods</a>?</p>
<p>The ultimate goal when you invest is to get a return on that investment, so make sure that you&#8217;re spending your money wisely and holding onto some for a rainy day.</p>
<p>If not, you&#8217;ll be paying for it in sweat equity.</p>
<p>I know this feeling all too well.</p>
<h2>Sweat Equity</h2>
<p>The other way that you&#8217;ll see a lot of business owners invest in their own company is through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_equity" target="_blank">sweat equity</a>.</p>
<p>Putting your own time and energy into a project is what sweat equity is, and the amount of return you get on your sweat equity is based on the amount of skill and drive you have within yourself.</p>
<p>Some people build businesses and hire out workers to create the actual products.</p>
<p>People like me <a href="http://robertdevore.com/wp-dispensary" target="_blank">build it</a> ourselves instead, putting sweat equity into the product, pushing it to become a sustainable source of income.</p>
<p>When that happens, then you can re-evaluate how you&#8217;re spending your cash and figure out different ways of investing in your business.</p>
<h3>Hard work pays off</h3>
<p>Building something yourself is very rewarding. The amount of joy I felt when I launched WP Dispensary is unrivaled by anything else I&#8217;ve done over the last decade.</p>
<p>Coming up with an idea, working on it (sometimes for months, like I did with <a href="http://www.wpdispensary.com" target="_blank">WP Dispensary</a>) and releasing it for the world to use is fucking awesome.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t done it yet, I&#8217;d highly recommend it. There&#8217;s no other feeling in the world that&#8217;s like it.</p>
<h3>Focus on the plan</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ve got your online accounts set up, you&#8217;ve got your business accounts set up and now it comes time to actually put the work in.</p>
<p>Are you going in blind, or do you have a business plan put together?</p>
<p>It can be a loose plan and should never been too long term. Things change in business much too fast for you to have a 10 year plan.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Sometimes you get muddled with all of the details and never actually get your business off the ground.</p>
<p>Planning can be endless. Instead of overthinking, try overdoing.</p>
<p>Get out there today and build something.</p>
<p>Blood sweat and tears go into great businesses, and if you&#8217;re not willing to invest in yourself, why should anyone else?</p>
<p>Long term goals are great, but have a loose plan on how you want to get there.</p>
<p>Then execute that plan relentlessly.</p>
<h3>One last piece of advice</h3>
<p>Investing in yourself is great, and it helps you to feel more confident about your business and yourself as a business owner.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t overspend.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to end up broke, scrambling to keep the lights on and food on your table while your business is barely off the ground.</p>
<p>Trust me, it&#8217;s not a great position to be in.</p>
<p>Save! Save! Save!</p>
<p>Whatever profit you receive, put a percentage of it away and never touch it. That&#8217;s your emergency funds and should only be used in times of great need.</p>
<p>Starting a business is rough, and the added pressure of not knowing how you&#8217;re going to pay your rent will only distract you from your main goals even more than you already may be.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let yourself get into that spot.</p>
<p>Work hard, be nice to people and save as much as possible. Then, and only then should you invest cash.</p>
<p>Until then, work the plan and sweat your ass off!</p>
