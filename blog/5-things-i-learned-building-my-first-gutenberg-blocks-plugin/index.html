    <div class="stattic-content mb-12">
        <p>Over the last few months I&#8217;ve watched as <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gutenberg</a> has been developed, silently taking notes, watching for patterns and possible areas to excel in.</p>
<p>Then I found that the domain <a href="http://pillar.press" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pillar.Press</a> was available and it snapped me into action.</p>
<p>You see, for about 6 months I&#8217;ve had the name <strong>Pillar</strong> saved as a name idea for a headless WordPress theme I wanted to create.</p>
<p>Last September, <a href="https://www.toddmotto.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Todd Motto</a> passed the <a href="https://github.com/html5blank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML5Blank</a> theme to me to take over development for.</p>
<p>It hasn&#8217;t received much in the way of updates over the past few years, but it has a strong following.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve cleaned it up a bit and launched a new <a href="http://html5blank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landing page</a>, but it&#8217;s code is so far behind WordPress standards I figure a fresh start was needed.</p>
<p>The plan was to use the name <strong>Pillar</strong> as the <em>&#8220;refreshed&#8221;</em> theme.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s got a new plan, because after a random search in <a href="https://namecheap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Namecheap</a> showed the <strong>Pillar.Press</strong> domain was available, the <strong>Pillar</strong> name is now being used for the <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/pillar-press-content-blocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custom Gutenberg blocks</a> I&#8217;m building.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1265" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/banner-772x250.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="305" /></p>
<h3>Building Blocks with Pillar Press</h3>
<p>If what they say is true, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gutenberg</a> is the future of WordPress, my hope is that <a href="http://pillar.press" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pillar Press</a> becomes the cornerstone of content creation with WordPress.</p>
<p>Since making the decision to use <a href="http://pillar.press" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Pillar Press</strong></a> as the name for my custom Gutenberg blocks solution, I&#8217;ve jumped in head first with all of the knowledge I&#8217;ve soaked up over the last few months.</p>
<p>As a WordPress developer who&#8217;s lived in Windows for 20+ years, I&#8217;ve recently made the switch to Linux full time and I am extremely happy I have.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot in these last few months, and feel that my skills as a developer have been growing at hyper-speed over the last few weeks while building <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/pillar-press-content-blocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my first blocks plugin</a>.</p>
<p>What better way to celebrate becoming a better developer than by documenting what you&#8217;ve learned on a recent project?</p>

<h2>How to use Node.js and NPM</h2>
<p>While I&#8217;ve written a lot of code in my life, I&#8217;ve been weary of working with Node or NPM, composer, etc.</p>
<p>Probably just the &#8220;if it ain&#8217;t broke don&#8217;t fix it&#8221; approach I had to my development for many years.</p>
<p>So, this time around I&#8217;ve told myself that I&#8217;ll do whatever is needed to learn Node and NPM.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was check to make sure I already had Node and NPM installed.</p>
<p>In the command line, you can do that like this: <code>node -v</code> and <code>npm -v</code>.</p>
<p>If you need to install either of them on Linux, you can do check out the official documentation to find the method to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">install via the package manager</a>.</p>
<p>For Windows users, Treehouse has a nice write up on how you can <a href="https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/node-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">install Node and NPM on Windows</a>.</p>
<h2>How to use create-guten-block to build a Blocks plugin</h2>
<p>If you do any serious work with WordPress and haven&#8217;t heard of Ahmad Awais, you need to catch up</p>
<p>Ahmad first put out a <a href="https://github.com/ahmadawais/Gutenberg-Boilerplate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gutenberg Boilerplate</a>, then upgraded that to the <a href="https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create-guten-block</a> solution for quickly building a Gutenberg Blocks plugin.</p>
<p>Again, this type of development (command line) wasn&#8217;t something I&#8217;ve been 100% comfortable with, so this pushed me outside of my comfort zones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned how to run <strong>NPM</strong> and figuring out how the build process worked, how to add a <strong>.gitignore</strong> file to a project in order to keep the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder from being sent to <a href="https://www.github.com/pillarpress/pillar-press-content-blocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>, and about a dozen other things.</p>
<h2>The more I use Gutenberg, the more I like it</h2>
<p>When I first seen <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gutenberg</a>, I hated it.</p>
<p>I think my gut reaction was because of the fear that I&#8217;d have to learn something so far outside of my comfort zone as a developer.</p>
<p>Over time, especially more recently as I&#8217;ve been developing for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gutenberg</a>, I&#8217;ve come to actually like the new content editor for WordPress.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a learning curve, sure, but who cares?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s coming to WordPress regardless of how you and I feel about having to learn something new in order to continue building plugins and themes with WordPress.</p>
<p>I realized that if I hated it so bad, I&#8217;d have to go learn some new CMS anyways, so why not stick with what I&#8217;ve developed with for over a dozen years?</p>
<p>That way of thinking is paying off.</p>
<p>After browsing articles, then installing and actually getting my hands dirty with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gutenberg</a>, I&#8217;ve found a hidden happiness when I tackle a new piece of code in a language I barely touched before, and quickly pick it up.</p>
<p>The learning curve actually isn&#8217;t that bad &#8211; and again, this is coming from a Windows developer who didn&#8217;t do anything in a command line for almost all 20 years that I&#8217;ve been developing for the web.</p>
<h2>Things are changing FAST with Gutenberg&#8217;s impending release</h2>
<p>The first block I built was a <strong>Spacer block</strong>, because it seemed like the easiest one to start with since there was only one option &#8211; the height of the space between blocks.</p>
<p>Well, in <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gutenberg v2.8</a> there is now a default <strong>Spacer block</strong> included.</p>
<p>So, now I have the joy of removing the first block I built and the <a href="https://www.github.com/pillarpress/pillar-press-content-blocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Blocks plugin</a> it was a part of is left with one less block.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s part of the fun in it all, right?</p>
<p>The constant change means that as a developer you and I have to constantly think about our next moves and what&#8217;s going to be best long-term.</p>
<p>Another change that&#8217;s happening right now is the move of several components from <strong>wp.blocks</strong> to <strong>wp.editor</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Important <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Gutenberg</a> change: we moved several `wp.blocks.*` components to `wp.editor.*` (RichText, PlainText, MediaUpload, &#8230;). This will help us move forward with some blocking points we had like accessing state from blocks, more detailed explanation: <a href="https://t.co/cjMuB9088t">https://t.co/cjMuB9088t</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Greg Ziółkowski (@gziolo) <a href="https://twitter.com/gziolo/status/993491209422295040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While not a huge change, it will cause problems for anyone who&#8217;s built a Gutenberg compatible plugin up to this point and has their components added the old way.</p>
<p>And again, that&#8217;s the beauty of building alongside a plugin like Gutenberg, the constant change keeps you on your feet as a developer.</p>
<p>Either that, or you fall miserably to your death in a pool of outdated skill-sets.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to see where Gutenberg goes over the next few months as it makes it&#8217;s way into WordPress core.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also excited to see <strong>Pillar Press</strong> grow into a powerful solution for WordPress users as they begin using Gutenberg.</p>
<p><strong>What about you?</strong></p>
<p>Have you started looking into Gutenberg yet and what you&#8217;ll do to upgrade your WordPress skills to work with it?</p>
<p>Or are you on the side of the fence that hates Gutenberg and everything it stands for?</p>
