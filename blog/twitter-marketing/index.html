        <p>When building your digital marketing strategy, social media websites like Twitter are usually at the top of the list. I mean, with over <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/282087/number-of-monthly-active-twitter-users/">300 million active users</a> on Twitter, you'd be hard pressed to find a marketing blog that doesn't recommend Twitter marketing tips, and for good reason.
But how can you supercharge your marketing efforts on Twitter and reach even a small percentage of those users?
Hopefully by the end of this article you'll have a better understanding of what works on Twitter and how you can use the right marketing mix to build a solid brand on the social media giant.</p>
<h2>Twitter Advanced Search Tips</h2>
<p>Every second on average, over <a href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/twitter-statistics/">6,000 Tweets</a> are sent through Twitter, which is over <strong>5 million tweets per day</strong>! That's a lot of noise to sift through, but luckily for you there is a way to instantly comb through the vast amounts of clutter and find the marketing gold you're looking for.
<img alt="Image source: Twitter" src="/images/tweets-per-second-stat.webp" />Image source: <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2013/new-tweets-per-second-record-and-how">Twitter</a>
Most regular users on Twitter will not know of the <a href="http://twitter.com/search-advanced">Advanced Search</a> feature that Twitter has, so they'll stick to the search bar at the top of the screen. This is OK for quick searches of hashtags or regular searches, but what about when you want to dive deep and really start targeting specifics on Twitter and <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/twitter-advanced-search-queries/">generating leads</a>?
The first thing you're going to want to do is head over to the <a href="http://twitter.com/search-advanced">Twitter Advanced Search</a> page and get yourself familiar with the <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/twitter-advanced-search">search features</a> that it offers.
With the Advanced Search page that Twitter offers, you're able to find tweets with positive or negative emotion, question marks, from a specific location, from a specific account and much more.
You are also able to pair your tweets down with a few handy tricks when typing your searches into any search box on Twitter.
<img alt="Image source: Buffer" src="/images/Twitter-search-operators.webp" />
Putting these tools into practice, you can do a search for your company name and see who's tweeting about you, even if they don't mention your Twitter handle. For instance, on the Advanced Search page, put your company name in quotes, and your website URL in the "Any of these words" section.
<img alt="twitter-advanced-search" src="/images/twitter-advanced-search.webp" />
You can also do some competitor spying and see who's tweeting about them with a negative emotion. This may be your chance to swoop in and help the Twitter user out and gain a new user/follower. Just make sure when doing this that you don't come off as a spammy douche-bag and are generally being helpful without pushing your offering on them.

<h2>Using Twitter lists to funnel the noise</h2>
<p>Listen, I understand that the noise is unbearable at times, especially when you follow thousands of other accounts. Your main Twitter stream becomes a never-ending flow of noise.
Twitter lists can help with that. When you're trying to build your Twitter marketing campaigns, the lists feature that's been built into Twitter <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/10/theres-list-for-that.html">since 2009</a> is a god send.
<img alt="Image source: Social Media Examiner" src="/images/twitter-list-image.webp" />Image source: <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/use-twitter-lists-business/">Social Media Examiner</a>
There's a couple of great ways to use Twitter lists to help your marketing efforts and push your business forward.
First, you can create a list of <a href="https://www.postplanner.com/101-best-twitter-lists-to-follow/">industry experts</a> that you'd like to keep up with. This will help you further your business by always staying on the cutting edge of things happening in your industry, and allow you to <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/8-twitter-tips-to-improve-your-twitter-marketing/">curate popular content</a> that you can share with your followers.
<img alt="Image source: Sprout Social" src="/images/create-twitter-list.webp" />Image source: <a href="http://sproutsocial.com/insights/twitter-lists/">Sprout Social</a>
Another great use for Twitter lists is to <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/use-twitter-lists-business/">cultivate business leads</a>. Keep this list private so only you can see it, and add accounts that you would like to do business with. Retweet their tweets when you like what they're saying, respond to their questions and be helpful as often as you can.
The more genuine you are in your engagements, the better your chances of turning your Twitter marketing efforts into results that benefit your business, while benefiting your customer at the same time.

<h2>Utilize your bio, avatar, banner and pinned tweets effectively</h2>
<p>It's been said a lot, but needs repeating once more - 650+ million! people <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/twitter-statistics/">actively use Twitter</a>, so you need to make sure that when even the smallest percentage of those people land on your bio, they find someone worth connecting with.
Your Twitter profile is now essentially a landing page where your avatar, bio copy, <a href="https://www.postplanner.com/get-more-retweets-pin-tweet-to-profile/">pinned tweet</a> and banner image are what users see as soon as your profile loads.
Approaching your profile like a landing page, there are some things you can do to effectively communicate who you are on a personal level as well as a business level.
Beyond tweeting content that people will like, your avatar is the item seen by most, from visiting your profile and seeing your tweets in their stream.
Make sure your picture is clear enough to show who you are, and clever enough to give people a glimpse at the human side of you 🙂
<img alt="image via Brand Watch" src="/images/twitter-egg-medley-stacked.webp" />Image source: <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/2016/03/industry-opinion-heres-how-id-monetise-twitter/">Brand Watch</a>
Your pinned tweet will act as a visual guide for people landing on your page on what you offer, and will be retweeted and favorited long after the original tweet is sent.
Use the pinned tweet to showcase a freebie you're giving away, or you can do what I've done on the WP Dispensary Twitter account (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/wpdispensary">@WPDispensary</a>) and use this space to promote a product you have for sale.
<a href="https://twitter.com/WPDispensary/status/741299852890509312"><img alt="cannabiz-pinned-tweet" src="/images/cannabiz-pinned-tweet.webp" /></a>
In your bio, utilize the entire 160 characters and give a real world description of who you are, what you do and how you can help others.
Knowing <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/how-to-write-a-twitter-bio">how to write an effective Twitter bio</a> can be the difference between gaining a follower, or losing the opportunity to network with another potential friend/client.
Here you can use a couple of hashtags like #freelance or #WordPress to describe what type of services you offer and <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-to-create-powerful-twitter-bio">connect your account</a> to discussions on the specific hashtag topics.
If you operate multiple accounts, you can use the Twitter bio of your main account to link your other accounts like I've done on my <a href="http://www.twitter.com/deviorobert">personal Twitter account</a> by adding the @DevioDigital and @WPDispensary usernames.
The cover photo of your profile is the largest area in size, yet seems to be under utilized by a lot of people. At 1500×500 in size, you can include a lot of information, turning your cover photo into a promotional banner for your business.
This space can showcase books you've written, a visual representation of your previous work or tell your brand's story and grab visitors attention so they don't click off of your profile before following you.
You can let the cover photo extend your personal branding like <a href="http://www.twitter.com/garyvee">Gary Vaynerchuk</a> does or use it like <a href="https://twitter.com/JackCanfield">Jack Canfield</a> and promote your products.
<img alt="cover-photo-examples" src="/images/cover-photo-examples.webp" />
The goal should be to use your Twitter cover photo in a <a href="http://blog.brand24.com/5-tips-on-twitter-cover-photo/">creative way</a> that helps grow your audience, build your brand and increase your revenue.
