            <p>On this day last year I <a href="http://robertdevore.com/going-all-in-with-wp-dispensary/">went all in</a> with WP Dispensary, leaving behind 10+ years of full time freelancing.</p>
<p>It was one of the most exciting times in my life, both professionally and personally.</p>
<p>I felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders when I was able to stop freelancing and focus full time on my own product.</p>
<p>Since then, a lot has happened, both professionally and personally.</p>
<p>I wanted to take some time today to reflect on the last year, talking about the things I&#8217;ve done, the things I&#8217;ve gone through and the things I&#8217;m working towards in this next year.</p>
<h2>I&#8217;ve learned a lot in the last year</h2>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of my &#8220;friends&#8221; weren&#8217;t really all they claimed to be.</li>
<li>There are things in my life I enjoy, and I can no longer spend time on anything else.</li>
<li>My health habits (or lack of) are starting to take effect, and I hate it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Professionally, I&#8217;ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>I jumped in to full time work at <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/">WP Dispensary</a> a little too early.</li>
<li>The cannabis industry is still very much in a state of flux, so what works today usually won&#8217;t work tomorrow.</li>
<li>WP Dispensary needs <a href="https://twitter.com/WPDispensary/status/1033824580207603712" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it&#8217;s own cart</a> solution instead of simply connecting to <a href="https://www.woocommerce.com">WooCommerce</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When life gets in the way</h3>
<p>I think one thing that I didn&#8217;t anticipate when I jumped in full time with <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> last year was that I did it at the beginning of the holiday season.</p>
<p>The holidays are chaotic by themselves, but last year I spent them with people who I knew shouldn&#8217;t have &#8211; and wasted a lot of time <em>and money</em> with.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my mistake for putting time and energy into people who don&#8217;t know what real friendship is and don&#8217;t know how to keep their mouth shut when it&#8217;s needed the most (long story &#8211;Â ?).</p>
<p>And no, this isn&#8217;t a cop out saying that other people caused the problems in my life &#8211; I know I did it, by fucking with people who didn&#8217;t deserve my time or energy.</p>
<p>Live and learn.</p>

<h3>I&#8217;ve been freelancing again</h3>
<p>Over the last few months I&#8217;ve been freelancing in order to keep life moving forward.</p>
<p>After Stripe, the payment processor I was using at <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com">WP Dispensary</a> shut my account down in January, I was left scrambling to find another processor.</p>
<p>Luckily I <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/recently-switched-credit-card-payment-processing-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found BlueSnap</a>, who have been great since the switch.</p>
<p>Then there was the time needed to set it up and switch over the entire store on WP Dispensary from <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Digital Downloads</a> to <a href="https://www.woocommerce.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WooCommerce</a> because the new processor only had a WooCommerce payment gateway plugin available.</p>
<p>If you look over at my <a href="https://github.com/robertdevore" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github account</a>, you can see that March through May I spent a LOT of time updating products, pushing code pretty much every day &#8211; and on days there weren&#8217;t, it was because I was pushing to a private repo on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitbucket</a>.</p>
<p>This was in addition to freelancing during that time.</p>
<p>I had to take freelance work in order to keep money coming in since <strong>WP Dispensary</strong>Â earnings dropped from the previous months of bullshit.</p>
<p>My wife will tell you that I was a zombie during these months, sleeping for a couple hours and at the computer the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>I worked hard to keep pushing updates to <a href="https://ww.wpdispensary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WP Dispensary</a> and get the earnings back up while still freelancing to pay the bills.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m still working on getting it back to the earnings it was last year at this time.</p>
<h3>Do I feel like a failure?</h3>
<p>Simple answer: No.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m being honest, I know that I jumped in too quick &#8211; and had zero savings to back me up when things shifted unexpectedly.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.stripe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> shutting my account down which left me scrambling to find another payment processor to keep money flowing, to the mountain of personal bullshit, I&#8217;m proud that I&#8217;m still standing.</p>
<p>On top of that, I know by looking back that there were times when I wasn&#8217;t as focused as I should have been, which contributed to lower than normal earnings.</p>
<p>Add in the cannabis industry itself changing at a frantic pace, with millions and millions of dollars of funding being pumped in for other technology companies, it&#8217;s safe to say this last 365 days has been a blur.</p>
<p>And that doesn&#8217;t even include the clients I&#8217;ve ran into who run off when it&#8217;s time to pay their bills &#8211; and try a Catfish level of fuckery for an explanation on where they&#8217;ve been.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">That awkward moment when a client tells you there&#39;s been a horrible car accident &#8230;</p>

<p>&mdash; Robert DeVore (@deviorobert) <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert/status/1044218252551958530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>But, I&#8217;m still here fighting without any outside help; funding or otherwise.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;ve had a couple people reach out privately to discuss funding but they turned out to be flakes.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s another story for another dayÂ ?</p>
<h2>Adjusting to the changes</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing to adjust to the changes and get myself back to full time work for myself and my own products.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s time for multiple streams of income</h3>
<p>One thing I would change if I was able to go back a year is to not put all my eggs in one basket.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I realized how much the <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> earnings were being padded with freelance earnings from the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/product/setup-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Setup Service</a> I offer.</p>
<p>The goal now is multiple streams of income, and I&#8217;ve already started this process by releasing <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/delivery-drivers-for-woocommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a free WordPress plugin to help streamline mobile workforces who use WooCommerce.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2501" src="/images/banner-772x250.webp" alt="" width="940" height="305" srcset="/images/banner-772x250.webp 940w, /images/banner-772x250-300x97.webp 300w, /images/banner-772x250-768x249.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></p>
<p><em>You can read the release notes for it <a href="http://robertdevore.com/delivery-drivers-for-woocommerce/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Building this plugin, I knew before even writing one line of code that a Pro version would follow.</p>
<p>My first thought was to sell it directly here on my personal site, but I remembered I have been looking for a way to re-brand the <strong>Devio Digital</strong> website, so I begin building the new site.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deviodigital.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Devio Digital</a> was launched a few days ago and now sells the <a href="https://deviodigital.com/product/delivery-drivers-for-woocommerce-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce Pro</a> plugin, with plans for multiple new plugins to follow.</p>
<p>For instance, my <a href="http://robertdevore.com/docupress-documentation-plugin-for-wordpress/">DocuPress</a> plugin had a new version released a few days ago and will begin being prepped for the <strong>DocuPress Pro</strong> version soon.</p>
<p>These plugins are just a small part of the much larger plan to have multiple streams of income, both online &amp; offline.</p>
<p>But all in due time.</p>
<h2>My Next Steps</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m starting another 90 day grind on <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> and will be documenting everything I&#8217;m doing each day to get myself to a better place in life.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">90 days until Christmas ðŸ™Œ</p>
<p>What are you doing to make the most of the time left?</p>
