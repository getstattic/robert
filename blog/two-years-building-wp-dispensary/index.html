            <p>Over the last two years, the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WP Dispensary</a> WordPress plugin has changed my entire life.</p>
<p>In these last two years, <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> has gone from being just a &#8220;thing&#8221; I built to a thing that powers hundreds of websites for cannabis businesses around the world.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also become my <a href="http://robertdevore.com/going-all-in-with-wp-dispensary/">full time job</a>, giving me the ability to leave 10+ years of freelancing behind.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to look back over these last two years, what <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> has done and where I plan on pushing it in the future.<!--more--></p>
<h2>How it all started</h2>
<p>For those of you who aren&#8217;t aware of <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> or how it came to be, let&#8217;s take a little trip back.</p>
<p>In 2015 I built the <a href="http://robertdevore.com/leafly-reviews-wordpress-plugin/">Leafly Reviews</a> plugin for <strong>WordPress</strong>.</p>
<p>It would grab reviews for dispensaries on <strong>Leafly</strong> via their (now closed) API and display them on a WordPress site via widget or shortcode.</p>
<p>When I released the plugin, it was a pivotal moment in my life because it was my first open source plugin release and it was part of an industry that was severely under served (it still is, IMO).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a few months after it&#8217;s release, <strong>Leafly</strong> decided to close down it&#8217;s API, for what I can only assume was to compete with how other larger dispensary menu sites were handling their API&#8217;s (<strong>Weedmaps</strong>, etc).</p>
<p>At that time, I took it personal.</p>
<p>I built an open source plugin that used the open API to give <a href="https://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> users a way to display their dispensary reviews without the need to link people to their <strong>Leafly</strong> profiles.</p>
<p>I was also planning on tapping into other areas of their API to make accompanying plugins that would help dispensary owners connect their <strong>Leafly</strong> account to their website.</p>
<p>Sure, it sounds like a crazy thought now, but the jury is still out on what the actual cause of the closure was.</p>
<h2>What happened next</h2>
<p>After building the <strong>Leafly Reviews</strong> plugin, my plan was to build something that was a bit more unique and useful beyond just <a href="https://www.leafly.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leafly</a>.</p>
<p>So, I started working on it.</p>
<p>I wrote code, wrote documentation, built the initial website and got it ready for launch &#8230; all without the Mrs even knowing ?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">One of my favorite things about the new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WPDispensary?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WPDispensary</a> project is that it&#39;s been completely secret from the Mrs.</p>
<p>&mdash; Robert DeVore (@deviorobert) <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert/status/668949190706380800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><em>Tweeting about WP Dispensary before it had a Twitter username</em></p>
<p>I teased a <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert/status/667510760902365184" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert/status/656810593698074624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">different</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert/status/667767383067611136" target="_blank" rel="noopener">screenshots</a> of the plugin once it got closer to launch, but still kept everything tight-lipped.</p>
<p>When it did <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/welcome-to-wp-dispensary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially launch</a>, I felt accomplished.</p>
<p>I did something that only a few months prior, I never even dreamed would be possible.</p>
<p>I put out the first version of a plugin that would completely change my life; I just didn&#8217;t know it at the time.</p>
<h2>The first year</h2>
<p>The first year was a blur.</p>
<p>I had a lot of personal setbacks throughout the year but I kept pushing <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> forward while still freelancing full time to pay the bills.</p>
<p>WPD started to get accompanying add-on&#8217;s, like <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/dispensary-coupons">Coupons</a> and <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/dispensary-downloads">Locations</a>.</p>
<p>I also spent time building out marketing materials beyond just code.</p>
<p>This include the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/marketing-for-dispensaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marketing for Dispensaries</a> e-book that was released in June of 2016.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I also have the pleasure of enjoying a lot of top shelf cannabis ?, so I spent time taking high quality photos and released 100 free <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/100-free-marijuana-stock-photos/">cannabis stock photos</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I originally released the <strong>Dispensary Display</strong>Â theme to work with <strong>WP Dispensary</strong>, but that theme has since been discontinued and replaced by the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/cannabiz">CannaBiz WordPress theme</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CannaBiz</strong> was released in <a href="https://twitter.com/WPDispensary/status/741299852890509312" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June of 2016</a> and has had 8 updates released between then and now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve wrote about that <strong>CannaBiz</strong> here <a href="http://robertdevore.com/cannabiz/">before</a> and it is currently the second highest selling item on the WP Dispensary website.</p>
<p>On September 1st 2016 <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> hit 1,000 downloads from the WordPress directory.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We officially hit 1,000 downloads from the WordPress plugin directory ðŸ™Œ</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who&#39;s downloaded &amp; used our plugin so far ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯</p>
<p>&mdash; WP Dispensary (@WPDispensary) <a href="https://twitter.com/WPDispensary/status/771309557561696256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Shortly after that milestone, I released the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/dispensary-top-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dispensary Top Sellers</a> add-on, giving dispensary owners the ability to mark items in their menu as featured and display them via their own widget or shortcode.</p>
<p>Along with that add-on, I released the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/dispensary-inventory-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inventory Management</a> add-on so shops can easily keep track of their available inventory, plus display out of stock messages, etc.</p>
<p>At the end of the first year, along with the 9 updates released throughout the year for <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> was the release of <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/dispensary-age-verification">Dispensary Age Verification</a>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Age Verification plugin has become the second most popular free plugin from WP Dispensary, besides WPD itself.</p>
<h2>The second year</h2>
<p>Again, there were a lot of personal setbacks in the second year, but I guess that&#8217;s how life goes so I don&#8217;t really focus too much on them.</p>
<p>Professionally, the second year started out strong with the release of the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/wooconnect-for-woocommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connect for WooCommerce</a> add-on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/wooconnect-for-woocommerce"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1048" src="/images/wpd-woocommerce-connect-add-on.webp" alt="" width="750" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>It provides users with the ability to connect their <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> menu to <a href="https://www.woocommerce.com">WooCommerce</a> and allow for sales via their own website.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It should be no surprise that this add-on is the highest selling item on the WP Dispensary website.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, the <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> plugin download count increased to just under 5,000 and the usage is up to 200+ active installs, according to the WordPress plugin directory.</p>
<p>The <strong>Dispensary Age Verification</strong> plugin also hit 2,500+ downloads.</p>
<p>Then came the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/top-5-wp-dispensary-code-snippets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 5 Code Snippets</a> for <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> published on May 16th, 2017.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/cannabiz">CannaBiz</a> celebrated it&#8217;s 1 year birthday with a showcase and version 1.5&#8217;s release, as well as a list of ways to extend the <strong>CannaBiz</strong> theme.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QshX5PkF0o"><p><a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/wordpress-plugins-to-extend-cannabiz-dispensary-theme/">WordPress plugins to extend the CannaBiz dispensary theme</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Year two also seen the release of the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/wp-dispensary-heavyweights-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heavyweights</a> add-on, which gives shop owners the ability to set prices from 2oz to 3lb.</p>
<p>On August 23rd, 2017 I released version 2.0 of the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/wooconnect-for-woocommerce-version-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connect for WooCommerce</a> add-on, which finally set up the instant product creation-and-linking when adding WP Dispensary products.</p>
<p>Shortly after, in September the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/styles-add-on-release-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Styles</a> add-on was released.</p>
<p>It gives you the ability to let your <em>Buy Now</em> buttons open up in a modal, as well as switch up the menu item shortcodes from a grid to a list.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1066" src="/images/wpd-styles-modal-sample-768x428.webp" alt="" width="768" height="428" /></p>
<p>Continuing along with the goal of being a solid resource for developers and dispensary owners, I put together two new pages on the <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> website:</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/for-developers/">Developers</a> and For <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/for-dispensaries/">Dispensaries</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1067" src="/images/code-snippets-screenshot.webp" alt="" width="1042" height="591" /></p>
<p>These pages each lay out the plugin(s), theme and code in an easy to understand way.</p>
<p>This also included new documentation &#8230; a lot of new <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Before the second year was up I released the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/dispensary-details-woocommerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dispensary Details for WooCommerce</a> plugin.</p>
<p>The plugin was built to work without needing <strong>WP Dispensary</strong>, simply adding the dispensary details to <a href="https://www.woocommerce.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WooCommerce</a> products directly.</p>
<p>It also received a nice write up on <a href="https://www.wptavern.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WP Tavern</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kZxqOyIu5Q"><p><a href="https://wptavern.com/new-dispensary-details-plugin-for-woocommerce-adds-cannabis-details-to-products">New Dispensary Details Plugin for WooCommerce Adds Cannabis Details to Products</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There were a total of 12 <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> releases in the second year (1.9.2 &#8211; 1.9.14) and just under 4,000 downloads (a nice size jump over year one).</p>
<p>Year two also got me a C&amp;D letter based on an add-on I released (and have since removed ?), but I won&#8217;t be talking about thatÂ ?</p>
<p>However, on a high note, I was able to leave freelancing behind on September 26th 2017 and devote 100% of my time to <strong>WP Dispensary</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s next?</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot in the works for <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WP Dispensary</a> in 2018, including the release of WP Dispensary version 2.0.</p>
<p>The plan is to have a setup wizard for the auto creation of menu pages, shortcode selection options, etc.</p>
<p>There will also be the inclusion of default template files, so users can have a clean and customized archive view of each menu type, plus a lot more.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also getting into domain flipping in 2018, focusing on the cannabis industry, of course.</p>
<p>Below are a couple of currently owned cannabis domains that I&#8217;ve acquired and set up landing pages on.</p>
<p>These domains are all open to offers for sale, so if you&#8217;re looking to jump in as a developer in the cannabis industry, maybe one of these domains will work for you!</p>
<p><strong>Currently Available</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dispensary.press">Dispensary.Press</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cannabiz.design">CannaBiz.Design</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Year three will also include the launch of the <a href="http://marijuanalawshq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marijuana Laws HQ</a> website, giving visitors an easy way to find specific cannabis laws by country, state and city.</p>
<p>That, along with <strong>The Chronicle</strong> newsletter / podcast I&#8217;m planning to launch will be additional educational resources to go along with the software development I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to be a bridge between the development community (WordPress specifically but not exclusively) and the cannabis community, and my hope is that these additional resources will continue to make that happen.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a secret project I&#8217;m working on and have let a few secrets slip on Twitter about.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">shhhh &#8230; it&#39;s a secret ðŸ™ŠðŸ˜‚ <a href="https://t.co/C9pDCbzkdx">pic.twitter.com/C9pDCbzkdx</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Robert DeVore (@deviorobert) <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert/status/879021753443504128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>That secret project will be the main focus in 2018, along with continued add-on and theme updates &#8211; plus a couple of other things that I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll blog about when the time comes.</p>
<p>Looking back, I&#8217;m extremely proud of where the last two years brought me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also extremely excited to see what the next two years will bring me!</p>
