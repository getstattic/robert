        <p><strong>Notice: This post has been updated for 2018.</strong>
Within the last few months we've seen <a href="http://www.thecannabist.co/2016/11/14/marijuana-legalization-election-2016-tipping-point/67407/">medical and recreational marijuana laws</a> pass in 8 out of 9 states.
This means there is going to be an influx of websites being built for new businesses with WordPress in the upcoming years.
It doesn't matter if you're the cannabis business owner or a freelancer/agency setting up that biz owners website, you should know what WordPress plugins will help make the website you're building solid, secure and professionally focused.
This article will cover the WordPress plugins that you should know about and utilize in 2017.</p>
<h2>WordPress SEO Plugins</h2>
<p>When it comes to search engine optimization, WordPress does a good job setting you up with a good SEO Base.
But when it comes to putting all of the SEO tools needed into place, Yoast does a great job.
It's the SEO plugin I use on my personal websites and the WordPress plugin I recommend to all of my clients and friends.
It's the plugin I would recommend for you as well.</p>

<h2>WordPress Backup Plugins</h2>
<p>If you've built websites for more than a year or two, I'm sure you've run into the moment when a website you were working on collapses into rubble and you didn't have a backup plan.
Maybe it was just me ðŸ™‚
Regardless, having a back up of your website is top priority if you treat your website like a business in any type of way.
With the proper backups, you can have your website go from <em>down for the count</em> , to back up and running in a matter of minutes.
My recommendation to anyone who ever asks is <strong>UpdraftPlus</strong>.
It's got everything you need in a backup solution and for most users, the free options are more than enough.</p>

<h2>WordPress Security Plugins</h2>
<p>A hot topic in recent years, web security WordPress plugins needs to be a key tool in your websites toolbox.
I've been a personal fan of the Sucuri plugin for my websites but have recently been testing out Wordfence and love it.
It seems over a million people think so too, making it the most downloaded security plugin for WordPress.</p>

<h2>WordPress Dispensary Plugins</h2>
<p>As the cannabis industry generates billions a year and continues going up each year, the WordPress plugins for dispensaries that cater to them and understand their industry become increasingly important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incoming humble brag ?
I have built <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> , the complete marijuana menu solution for WordPress and believe it is the only solution you need to power your cannabis business website.
WP Dispensary gives you a complete menu solution to display each of your current products from Flowers to Concentrates, Edibles and more.
There's also a growing ecosystem of add-ons that give you inventory management, WooCommerce connection and more.</p>
