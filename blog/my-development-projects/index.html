            <p>Since late last year I&#8217;ve been hard at work on various development projects. While I&#8217;ve spent time blogging about each of them here, I haven&#8217;t updated the posts with new details about each of the projects.</p>
<p>This post is aiming to do that.</p>
<h2>WP Dispensary</h2>
<p>This has been my biggest focus the last couple of months. What <a href="http://www.wpdispensary.com/welcome-to-wp-dispensary/" target="_blank">started</a> in November of last year has quickly turned into a pet project with the potential of growing into a full fledged business.</p>
<p>Since I <a href="http://robertdevore.com/wp-dispensary/">first blogged</a> about WP Dispensary here, I&#8217;ve released two new versions (<a href="http://www.wpdispensary.com/wp-dispensary-version-1-2/" target="_blank">1.2</a> and <a href="http://www.wpdispensary.com/wp-dispensary-version-1-3/" target="_blank">1.3</a> respectively).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/deviodigital/dispensary-display-wordpress-theme" target="_blank">Dispensary Display</a> theme that was built and originally for sale through the WP Dispensary website. Updates are coming to this theme in the next week or two, enhancing it further.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Clean Blog</h2>
<p>The very first piece of open source code I&#8217;ve released, the <a href="http://robertdevore.com/clean-blog-free-wordpress-theme/">Clean Blog WordPress theme</a> is something I&#8217;m very proud of and have continued to update since it&#8217;s release in August of last year.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of new enhancements built in since the original release, including an option to darken the header or change the background color default, which you can see in the <a href="https://github.com/deviodigital/cleanblog/" target="_blank">Github repository</a>.</p>
<p>I have a couple more updates to push and I&#8217;ll blog about everything that&#8217;s been updated here as soon as it&#8217;s all pushed live.</p>
<h2>miniQuiz</h2>
<p>One of the things I told myself this year was that I would learn Angular.js and the <a href="https://github.com/deviodigital/miniQuiz" target="_blank">miniQuiz</a> was my first attempt at working with it.</p>
<p>It was originally a fork of the <a href="http://odhyan.com/blog/2014/12/building-a-simple-quiz-app-using-angularjs/" target="_blank">QuizApp</a>, built by Saurabh Odhyan. I started by just adding in a tweet results option for the end of the quiz, but then decided to take it further.</p>
<p>The miniQuiz Angular app got put into a bootstrap template and styled to give it a more polished look. I also took the questions and changed them to some hip hop questions.</p>
<p>Future plans are building a way to easily recreate the quizzes, possibly done through a CMS of some sort. Still under development, so I couldn&#8217;t say for sure when this will happen.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;ve really enjoyed working with Angular and I&#8217;ve got ideas for a few other app ideas and will be diving into iPhone and Android app development soon.</p>
<h2>Slackedd</h2>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.easydigitaldownloads.com" target="_blank">Easy Digital Downloads</a> a lot, and since everybody seems to be using Slack for communication with teams and business contacts, I knew that this plugin could help.</p>
<p>Slackedd is a free WordPress plugin you can download from the Github repository (no WordPress repo, <a href="http://robertdevore.com/slackedd/">read why here</a>).</p>
<p>It will send a notification through your Slack channel of choice whenever your EDD powered store makes a sale.</p>
<p>Simple, but effective.</p>
<h2>Leafly Reviews</h2>
<p>My first official WordPress plugin accepted into the repository was Leafly Reviews. I was happy when I first released it since it was the first time I worked with an API. I was proud of the work I did for the plugin.</p>
<p>Then Leafly decided that they were closing down their API, which made the plugin useless. I&#8217;ve left it in the repository and Github is still hosting it, in case Leafly renews their API and I can get the plugin back in working order again.</p>
<p>This happened right after I built the <a href="https://github.com/deviodigital/leafly-specials-wordpress-plugin" target="_blank">Leafly Specials</a> plugin. So now they&#8217;re both not usable. I guess it works for the best, because I&#8217;ve now released the Dispensary Coupons plugin on <a href="https://github.com/deviodigital/dispensary-coupons" target="_blank">Github</a>, and will be getting the final version ready for release in the official WordPress plugin repository.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/deviodigital/dispensary-coupons" target="_blank">Dispensary Coupons</a> is a lightweight plugin that lets you add and edit coupons directly through your WordPress dashboard, much like you do blog posts. It comes with the ability to display your coupons with a widget or shortcode.</p>
<h2>What development projects are next?</h2>
<p>The next thing I&#8217;ll be spending my time working on is the blog at WP Dispensary. I&#8217;ve been releasing <a href="http://www.wpdispensary.com/25-free-marijuana-stock-photos/" target="_blank">free marijuana stock photography</a> recently, and have plans on writing content for dispensary owners to build better marketing strategies, better websites, and better businesses as a whole.</p>
<p>I also am working on the official launch of the Devio Digital website. The focus has changed a bit from what I originally had it set up for (showcasing my open source projects). There&#8217;s an example of what&#8217;s to come on Twitter (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/deviodigital" target="_blank">@DevioDigital</a>).</p>
<p>Other than that, everything is still full steams ahead into Spring.</p>
<p>I said all of that, to say this &#8211; I hope you&#8217;re making the most of your time and building things that excite you.</p>
<p>We all deserve to be happy. Do things that put a smile on your face. Life is too short for bullshit.</p>
<h4>Keep in touch</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m social on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/deviorobert" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/deviorobert" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. I&#8217;m also actively coding on <a href="https://www.github.com/robertdevore" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
