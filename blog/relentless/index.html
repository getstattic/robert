        <p><strong>I will hold $1,000,000 in my hands.</strong></p>
<p>Bold statement, right?</p>
<p>Well, if fortune favors the bold, I plan on cashing in on it.</p>
<p>I understand that <a href="https://therisetothetop.com/davids-blog/myth-of-overnight-success/">overnight success</a> doesn&#8217;t mean that tomorrow morning I&#8217;ll wake up and be rich.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been building websites for almost 2 decades.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been releasing open source code for a little over a year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com">WP Dispensary</a> for a little less than a year.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve known where I want to get to (that $1M cash in hand) for my whole life.<!--more--></p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of ups and downs throughout the years, and many lessons learned.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now time to get a grip, buckle down and really put things into overdrive.</p>
<p>The plan is simple; work at a relentless pace, focused on constant improvements no matter how small, and never let up on the gas.</p>

<p>In order to get to my ultimate business goal, there&#8217;s some smaller steps along the way that I will need to take.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;ve been looking over my life and finding ways to better myself, I&#8217;ve been stuck on the word &#8220;relentless&#8221;.</p>
<p>I feel like when it comes to the goals I have in my life, this is the approach that will work best for me.</p>
<p>Some people might find a more relaxed approach is better, but for me the grind is where I feel most at home.</p>
<p>I have a never-ending hunger for success, and with the relentless pace I set for myself, I know I will accomplish all of my goals, big and small.</p>
<p>But without a proper plan in place, that&#8217;ll never work no matter how hard I work. So I&#8217;ve come up with some plans to help me get to where I&#8217;m trying to go.</p>
<h2>Daily¬†work</h2>
<p>Building daily habits is one of the biggest tips on how to better your life, yet most people overlook this &#8211; myself included.</p>
<p>So my plan is simple; write down three actionable goals every day, work on these first before anything else and know¬†that they&#8217;ll put me closer to my goals.</p>
<p>These daily goals won&#8217;t be monstrous items like &#8220;create a new WordPress plugin and release it&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead, they&#8217;ll be smaller goals like &#8220;update the meta data output for WP Dispensary&#8221;.</p>
<p>By setting small goals for business, I&#8217;m able to every week look back and see at leas 21 things I&#8217;ve done to better myself, better my business and put me closer to the $1M goal.</p>
<h2>Weekly goals</h2>
<p>Every week I plan on having somewhat larger goals I would like to accomplish.</p>
<p>For instance, on Twitter¬†I started using the #WPDWednesdays hashtag.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WPDWednesdays?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WPDWednesdays</a> release and it&#39;s a great one üëçüëç <a href="https://t.co/Pol6TloNg6">https://t.co/Pol6TloNg6</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Devio Digital (@DevioDigital) <a href="https://twitter.com/DevioDigital/status/793845559828189184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Every Wednesday I will be releasing something new, or an update to an add-on or theme.</p>
<p><strong>Every. Single. Week.</strong></p>
<p>This means that every month I will have at least 4 releases to the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com">WP Dispensary</a> ecosystem.</p>
<p>Sure, that might not sound like much by itself, but when you take 52 weeks in a year that means I&#8217;ll be 52 releases ahead of anyone who&#8217;s still in their planning stage.</p>
<p>As long as I hit that goal every Wednesday, I&#8217;ll feel like my weekly goal is accomplished.</p>
<p>But I won&#8217;t be stopping there. There&#8217;s more to do in business than just releases.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s writing documentation, marketing through social media and a million other things that need done.</p>
<p>So, every week I&#8217;ll be doing those things as well. Similar to how I set up my daily goals list, I&#8217;ll have a weekly goals list too, and on this list I&#8217;ll have <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WPDWednesdays?src=hash">#WPDWednesdays</a> along with a couple of other larger goals.</p>
<h2>Monthly maintenance</h2>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve got goal lists set for myself, I&#8217;ll need to take stock of what&#8217;s working and how I can pivot in order to better myself and my business week after week.</p>
<p>This is where the monthly maintenance comes into place.</p>
<p>Not only will I be looking over what I&#8217;ve done for the month, I&#8217;ll plan out ideas for the upcoming month that will take center stage in my weekly tasks, and hammered out through the daily tasks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also take monthly stock of my web properties and look for things that are working great and find ways that I can increase traffic and revenue.</p>
<h2>Physical Fitness</h2>
<p>This is an area of my life that I&#8217;ve neglected more than I&#8217;d like to admit.</p>
<p>Sure, I&#8217;ve kept up with a somewhat normal workout schedule (a <em>&#8216;three weeks on, 4 months off&#8217;</em> type of normal).</p>
<p>Instead of pretending that I&#8217;m doing enough, I have made a conscious decision to start working out more regularly.</p>
<p>I plan on doing something every day, regardless of how big or small of a workout it is.</p>
<p>Like everything else in life, as long as I&#8217;m moving forward, I&#8217;m OK with that, because in the long run these small wins will add up and pay off.</p>
<p>The hope here is that the increased physical fitness helps my business as well by keeping me clear headed¬†and relaxed.</p>
<p>Plus, while I&#8217;m feeling stronger physically, that should be overflowing into my mental strength which will benefit my business goals.</p>
<p>Win/Win¬†?</p>
<h2>Key takeaway</h2>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>That sums up my views when it comes to my personal life and my business life.</p>
<p>As long as I&#8217;m making focused moves towards all of my goals, I&#8217;ll get to where I want to be in life.</p>
<p>With all that said, it&#8217;s time to get back to the grind.</p>
<p>See you at the top!</p>
