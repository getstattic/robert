            <p>It&#8217;s been nearly 7 years since I first <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/welcome-to-wp-dispensary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> WP Dispensary ????</p>

<p>On November 26th, 2015 I published <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/welcome-to-wp-dispensary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this article</a> announcing to the world that I built the first <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dispensary">cannabis menu plugin</a> for WordPress.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it was met with both good and bad responses ????</p>

<p>Some people knew where the industry was heading and seen the need for this type of plugin. </p>

<p>While others still couldn&#8217;t look past the typical stigmas surrounding the cannabis plant itself to even consider an entire industry being built around it.</p>

<p> I stayed focused and didn&#8217;t let anyone else opinions drown out what I knew to be true, and I met near-instant success.</p>

<p>Over the course of the first year, I got the plugin&#8217;s pro add-on&#8217;s to a point where I thought I could quit freelancing full time to <a href="http://robertdevore.com/going-all-in-with-wp-dispensary/">run WP Dispensary exclusively</a>, but that was short lived.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="266" src="/images/lets-give-it-a-shot.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-6440"/></figure>

<p>At the time, I was naive about what exactly would be required to run a business like this full time.</p>

<p>Fast forward 6 years and I am more confident in my ability to provide an elevated experience for businesses within the cannabis industry.</p>

<p>I am also confident in the ~7 years of consistent updates and product enhancements that I&#8217;ve released to make the suite of plugins what it is today.</p>

<p>This current codebase is lightyears ahead of what I launched in 2015.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s been happening?</h2>

<p>Last year I made a decision to move forward with my plans, registered the LLC and I am now about to launch my new MRR business:</p>

<p></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="632" height="101" src="/images/cannabiz-logo-simple-2.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-6430" srcset="/images/cannabiz-logo-simple-2.webp 632w, /images/cannabiz-logo-simple-2-300x48.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://cannabiz.pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CannaBiz Software, LLC</a>.</p>

<p>Set to launch on the 7 year anniversary of WP Dispensary&#8217;s first release, <strong>CannaBiz</strong> will provide a hosted suite of WordPress plugins to cannabis dispensary and delivery services.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had conversations with people from the very beginning who said I needed to turn WP Dispensary into a SaaS business. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve always <em>wanted</em> to do, and I am now in a position to make this dream a reality &#8211; but <a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/1547265192727289858">it&#8217;s not SaaS</a>, so I&#8217;ll simply refer to it as a MRR business.</p>

<p><strong>CannaBiz</strong> is uniquely positioned to provide what&#8217;s required to power high performing websites that use our software.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="335" src="/images/gt-metrix-demo-wp-dispensary-1024x335.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-6444" srcset="/images/gt-metrix-demo-wp-dispensary-1024x335.webp 1024w, /images/gt-metrix-demo-wp-dispensary-300x98.webp 300w, /images/gt-metrix-demo-wp-dispensary-768x251.webp 768w, /images/gt-metrix-demo-wp-dispensary-1536x503.webp 1536w, /images/gt-metrix-demo-wp-dispensary-2048x670.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The demo site&#8217;s <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/reports/demo.wpdispensary.com/Jia28NMK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GT Matrix</a> score âš¡</figcaption></figure>

<p>The goal is to give dispensary and delivery services a simple way to host their own menus without third-party services like Weedmaps and Leafly.</p>

<p>And by building a business on the open source codebase that was also built in-house, CannaBiz is in a unique position to provide a better quality alternative at a much lower cost.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="200" src="/images/im-the-surprise.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-6442"/></figure>

<p>Beyond the main suite of plugins CannaBiz Software provides, I&#8217;m also be including other must-have plugins for SEO, contact forms, popups and more.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s coming next?</h2>

<p>As we get closer to the launch date, I will be blogging about the various features that CannaBiz Software will be providing and what customers can expect:</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Menu management</li>



<li>Online ordering </li>



<li>Inventory Management</li>



<li>Analytics and Reports</li>



<li>Loyalty and Rewards</li>



<li>Product Reviews</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;ll also break down some of the business decisions I&#8217;ve made, the products/services I&#8217;m using to manage the business itself and what my goals are with running my first MRR business.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="260" src="/images/rock-n-roll.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-6445"/></figure>
