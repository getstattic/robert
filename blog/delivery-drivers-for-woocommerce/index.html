        <p>Today I am happy to announce the release of my newest open source plugin, <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/delivery-drivers-for-woocommerce">Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2506" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-logo.png" alt="Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce logo" width="710" height="90" srcset="https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-logo.png 710w, https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-logo-300x38.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></p>
<p>As you can probably guess by the name, it&#8217;s a plugin for WooCommerce that adds functionality for businesses who offer delivery and would like greater control over the entire process.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that I built this plugin is because of a client need via <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WP Dispensary</a>, but I did not want to pigeonhole it as another <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dispensary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dispensary plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Since there&#8217;s many businesses that offer delivery beyond just the cannabis industry, I knew this plugin would be better built as it&#8217;s own separate entity.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what this blog post is about &#8211; the release of the Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce plugin, and what you can expect when using it.</p>
<h2>Delivery Businesses &amp; WooCommerce</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve all seen the rise of grocery delivery services &#8211; the tides are changing, and where we used to enjoy trips across town, consumers are now looking for ways to have things brought to us.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where delivery businesses in the food industry (hello, Pizza) come into play.</p>
<p>Studies indicate that <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1986/food-delivery-industry-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">10% of consumers</a> use food delivery services at least once a week, and that&#8217;s just one service business that offers delivery.</p>
<p>Restaurant and grocery stores not only offer delivery for their customers, but place orders and have items delivered to them on a weekly basis, too.</p>
<p>So this same plugin can power the restaurant&#8217;s online delivery management, and also power the restaurant&#8217;s food vendors who deliver truck loads of fresh produce every week.</p>
<p>And while upwards of $4B dollars was spent ordering food delivery in 2015, we cannot overlook the multi-billion dollar cannabis industry that offer delivery services and need an easy way to manage drivers and track orders.</p>
<p>With industries this large, there&#8217;s no reason for WooCommerce to not have a delivery driver system for businesses who need them.</p>
<p>Since I couldn&#8217;t find anything remotely useful available, I decided to build it myself.</p>
<h2>How the plugin works</h2>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve covered some of the reasons behind building the plugin and the markets that it serves, let&#8217;s jump into how it actually works!</p>
<h3>Delivery Drivers WooCommerce Settings</h3>
<p>First things first, once you&#8217;ve installed &amp; activated the plugin, you&#8217;re going to want to head over to the Settings page.</p>
<p>You can find the Delivery Drivers settings by going to <code>WooCommerce -&gt; Settings -&gt; Delivery Drivers</code>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2510" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-1.jpg" alt="Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce Settings screenshot" width="977" height="566" srcset="https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-1.jpg 977w, https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-1-300x174.jpg 300w, https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-1-768x445.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px" /></p>
<p>The settings page allows you to add your Google Maps API key which is required in order for the map to display on your driver&#8217;s dashboard.</p>
<p>You can also add your dispatch phone number, which then adds a contact button on the order page in your drivers dashboard.</p>
<p>Adding this contact info lets your drivers easily connect to your dispatch center with any questions they have about the order.</p>
<h3>Assigning a driver to each order</h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve taken care of the settings page, it&#8217;s time to start assigning a driver to your order.</p>
<p>In your dashboard, go to <code>WooCommerce -&gt; Orders</code> and then edit any of your orders, which will bring up a screen like the image below.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_2513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2513" style="width: 750px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-2513" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-5-1024x318.jpg" alt="Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce - Assign Driver to Order" width="750" height="233" srcset="https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-5-1024x318.jpg 1024w, https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-5-300x93.jpg 300w, https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-5-768x239.jpg 768w, https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-5.jpg 1346w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2513" class="wp-caption-text">click to enlarge</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In the <strong>Delivery Driver</strong> box on the right side of the screen, you&#8217;ll see a list of every user in your website with the Driver role that you can choose from.</p>
<p>Then, on the left side of the screen where the <strong>Status:</strong> is currently <code>Processing</code>, you can change the status to <code>Driver Assigned</code>.</p>
<h2>Drivers Capabilities</h2>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve covered how the administrator of the website can work with the Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce plugin, let&#8217;s see what capabilities are given to your drivers.</p>
<h3>Views from the Driver dashboard</h3>
<p>On the front end of your website, the plugin adds a new &#8220;Delivery Drivers&#8221; tab to the WooCommerce My Account page, as seen below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2512" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-3.jpg" alt="Assigned Orders - Driver Dashboard - Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce" width="977" height="566" srcset="https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-3.jpg 977w, https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-3-300x174.jpg 300w, https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-3-768x445.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px" /></p>
<p>When the driver clicks to view the Delivery Drivers page, they are given a table view of each order that&#8217;s been assigned to them.</p>
<p>These details include the order ID number, the date of the order, it&#8217;s current status and the total cost for the order.</p>
<p>The order ID links to a separate page for your driver to further manage the order.</p>
<h3>Order status management by your drivers</h3>
<p>Once your driver clicks the ID number they&#8217;d like to view order details for, they are displayed with another page, like in the screenshot below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2509" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-4.jpg" alt="Driver Dashboard Order Edit - Delivery Drivers for WooCommerce" width="977" height="566" srcset="https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-4.jpg 977w, https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-4-300x174.jpg 300w, https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ddwc-screenshot-4-768x445.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px" /></p>
<p>This page shows basic order details, along with a list of items in the order, the delivery address and Google map of the location, plus order status management.</p>
<h3>Order Status management</h3>
<p>Under the map is where your driver can change the order status. The default option is to change the order status from <code>Driver Assigned</code> to <code>Out for Delivery</code>.</p>
<p>Once they&#8217;ve clicked the button to mark the order as <code>Out for Delivery</code>, the status option changes to allow the driver to mark the order as <code>Complete</code> after they&#8217;ve made the delivery.</p>
<p>The goal is to give your driver the ability to manage the order status themselves and free up your time to spend it elsewhere on the business &#8211; or hell, maybe even take some time off ?</p>
