        <p>Creativity comes in many forms. Today, I would like to display another form of creative expression I have been interested in with a Sons of Anarchy fanfiction story.
I've wrote fiction for as long as I can remember, and a couple of years ago I started working on a Sons of Anarchy fanfiction about life after the series finale.</p>
<h3>Why Sons of Anarchy?</h3>
<p>The Mrs and I were big fans of the show when it was on the air and I always thought it would be fun to try my hand writing a story like this.
Kurt Sutter did an amazing job crafting the show from beginning to end, so I hope that my first stab at fanfiction is at least on par with the twists and turns that Kurt put into the original SOA.
The story will be a continuation from the series finale and will not be written in an alternative universe where the main characters are living completely different lives.
This story is how I feel the family would have continued on after the show ended.
A couple of years have actually gone by since I wrote the prologue and first two chapters. I'm publishing these in an attempt to get me to finish this story before <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org">NaNoWriMo</a>, when I plan on writing a full novel.
It's also a good way for me to test out the <a href="http://robertdevore.com/chapters-for-authors-wordpress-plugin/">Chapters for Authors</a> plugin I built and released a few months ago.</p>
<h3>Chapters for Authors</h3>
<p>Now that I've had the chance to use the plugin, adding in my first book and a couple chapters I have the ability to see what needs updated in the plugin.
There's a few things I need to update, like the addition of a widget and shortcode to display a list of books, chapters, etc. I've also got a few other ideas on how to make the plugin more robust, which is being actively worked on.
The release for this will be coming soon, I'm working on a few other things over at <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com">WP Dispensary</a> first.
If you use the Chapters for Authors plugin and have any ideas on how to make it better, let me know!</p>
<h2>My Brothers Keeper</h2>
<p>Below are links to the prologue and first two chapters.

  * <a href="http://robertdevore.com/chapter/01/">01 - Chapter 1</a>
  * <a href="http://robertdevore.com/chapter/02/">02 - Chapter 2</a></p>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>There's additional chapters being worked on and will be published soon.
Let me know if you want to be updated on Twitter (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/deviorobert">@deviorobert</a>), where I'm sure I'll be tweeting about it as more chapters are released.</p>
