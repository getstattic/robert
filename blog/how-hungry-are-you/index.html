        <p>This question changed everything.</p>

<p>I was in the middle of writing a blog post titled &#8220;Hitting pause&#8221;, outlining how I was going to be pushing back the <a href="https://cannabiz.pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CannaBiz Software</a> launch and focus my efforts elsewhere.</p>

<p>Then out of nowhere I was given an opportunity for additional work outside of my regular nine to five hours.</p>

<p>Along with the proposal for the extra work, the statement &#8220;let me know how hungry you are&#8221; came with it.</p>

<p><em>How hungry am I?</em></p>

<p>Good question. Easy answer.</p>

<p>Answer: <strong>I like to eat.</strong></p>

<p>But how much did I <em>actually</em> like to eat?</p>

<p>I was just in the process of clearing off my plate and then someone slapped a fat ass steak on top of it.</p>

<p>So if I <em>really</em> liked to eat, why was I ignoring all of the food I already had on my plate?</p>

<p>Was it stale? Did I not enjoy the flavor anymore? WHY was I getting rid of it in the first place?</p>

<p>To be honest, the stuff I was planning take off the table was stuff I actually enjoyed &#8230; a lot.</p>

<p>Building WP Dispensary in 2015 was a pivotal moment in my life and has guided me over the last 7 years.</p>

<p>I was wrestling with this decision for a few weeks, which is why the blog post was stuck in draft mode.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t want to let go of it all, but my life was a chaotic mess and I was having trouble figuring out how to sort it all out.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;let me know how hungry you are&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time, even if from the outside it looks like one of the worst times to add more tasks to my plate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Thriving under pressure</h2>

<p>My whole life I&#8217;ve worked best with my back against the wall.</p>

<p>Fighting out of the corner has been my bread and butter, mainly out of necessity but also because I enjoy it.</p>

<p>I have been the underdog for so long, I think I forgot what it was like to just live a regular life without a thousand pounds of pressure on your shoulders.</p>

<p>When did I start to feel that way? When my son was born in June 2020.</p>

<p>Looking back, I started to &#8220;check out&#8221; mentally and put all of my focus and attention on making sure my family was as good as it could possibly be.</p>

<p>This meant a lot less time was spent writing code, blogging, and spending time on social media.</p>

<p>I spent my day juggling a (first in almost 20 years) full time job and brand new son.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t have the mental space to add anything else to my plate at that time. </p>

<p>But instead of clearing my plate off when I was obviously full, I just left the food there and stared at it &#8230; a lot.</p>

<p>This went on all the way until a couple of weeks ago when I started writing the &#8220;Hitting pause&#8221; blog post.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So am I hitting pause, or not?</h2>

<p>Yes, and no.</p>

<p>The official launch of CannaBiz Software will be pushed back until sometime in the spring of 2023.</p>

<p>This gives me the time to put the proper pieces in place for the launch instead of half-assing it in order to meet an arbitrary deadline I set for myself.</p>

<p>The plugins at Devio Digital will continue to live on and will have updates pushed out, mainly the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/boostbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BoostBox</a> plugin (more on that soon).</p>

<p>These plugins will not be top priority until at least mid-year 2023 so I can focus more on the CannaBiz launch and all of the code work that will go along with that.</p>

<p><a href="https://wpdispensary.com">WP Dispensary</a> will continue to live on, but will be changing up its pro plugin lineup to a more streamlined offering (more on that soon).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Time to eat</h2>

<p>My back is against the wall again, just how I like it. And this time it&#8217;s by design.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got a clear mind and a solid plan for the next 3-6 months that&#8217;ll put all of the pieces in place for the long run.</p>

<p>In the meantime, lets eat.</p>
