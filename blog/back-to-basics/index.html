        <p>I always thought Impostor Syndrome was bullshit.
Then I realized I was 6 months in to running WP Dispensary <a href="http://robertdevore.com/going-all-in-with-wp-dispensary/">full time</a> and I had no idea what I was doing.
Recently, I've been working on <a href="http://robertdevore.com/wp-dispensary-v2/">WPD v2.0</a> and have pushed myself to do things with code that I haven't before.
This lead me to question my whole entire existence, as both a developer and a human being.
<strong>Seriously.</strong>
It's taken some getting used to, but I have come to grips with the impostor syndrome within.
I've also realized what I need to do in order to make sure that I never feel this uncomfortable again.</p>
<h2>Getting back to the basics</h2>
<p>It's been over a dozen years since I started editing WordPress themes, learning PHP in the process.
The "<em>learning on the job "</em> has got me here, and I'm thankful for it.
But I've grown so much as a developer over the last couple of years that I feel like I'm doing myself a disservice by not going back and re-learning the basics of PHP and other languages I write in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Slowly realizing I only learned PHP over the years because of WordPress.
I'm also realizing that learning PHP "the WordPress way" allowed me to overlook a lot of PHP basics.
Going to fix this, and study like a beginner üëç <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NeverNotWorking?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NeverNotWorking</a>
-- Robert DeVore (@deviorobert) <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert/status/976496147777847296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2018</a>
Sure, I've learned a lot of PHP over the years, along with a handful of other languages, but the learning has been fractured at best.
I've never taken a course, read any developer-related books, or done much more than Google searches, skimming blog posts and hacking together code until it worked.
I really feel like I'm missing out on my full potential as a developer by not learning the basics of the languages I write in.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>So, what am I gonna do about it?</h2>
<p>For starters, I'm writing this blog post and making a public declaration that I'm <em>actually</em> going to do something about it ?
While I continue working on the release of WP Dispensary v2.0 (which is less than a week away as I type this), I will continue <em><strong>" learning on the job"</strong></em>.
I will also be taking the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/php">PHP course</a> at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>.
Over 900 thousand others have taken the course, and it says it's only about 4 hours from start to finish, so I feel like it'll give me a solid - and quick - overview of PHP.
This video also gives a nice, brief run down of PHP, so I plan on watching this a couple of times while working on projects.
Because I want to continue making <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com">WP Dispensary</a> better, and offering full Gutenberg support when WordPress switches editors, I plan on also learning JavaScript basics.
One of the first things I'll be doing is watching this video, which has over 1 million views and packs a lot of the basics of JavaScript into such a short video.
I've also been looking into a couple of courses, like the <a href="https://javascriptforwp.com/">JavaScript for WordPress</a> course from <a href="https://twitter.com/zgordon">Zac Gordon</a>.
This is really going to be a life long journey, but I'm really happy to be jumping off the edge at this point in my life and (hopefully) learning to fly on the way down ?</p>
