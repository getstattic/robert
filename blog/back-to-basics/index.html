            <p>I always thought Impostor Syndrome was bullshit.</p>
<p>Then I realized I was 6 months in to running WP Dispensary <a href="http://robertdevore.com/going-all-in-with-wp-dispensary/">full time</a> and I had no idea what I was doing.</p>
<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve been working on <a href="http://robertdevore.com/wp-dispensary-v2/">WPD v2.0</a> and have pushed myself to do things with code that I haven&#8217;t before.</p>
<p>This lead me to question my whole entire existence, as both a developer and a human being.</p>
<p><strong>Seriously.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken some getting used to, but I have come to grips with the impostor syndrome within.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also realized what I need to do in order to make sure that I never feel this uncomfortable again.</p>
<h2>Getting back to the basics</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s been over a dozen years since I started editing WordPress themes, learning PHP in the process.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<em>learning on the job&#8221;</em> has got me here, and I&#8217;m thankful for it.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve grown so much as a developer over the last couple of years that I feel like I&#8217;m doing myself a disservice by not going back and re-learning the basics of PHP and other languages I write in.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Slowly realizing I only learned PHP over the years because of WordPress.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also realizing that learning PHP &quot;the WordPress way&quot; allowed me to overlook a lot of PHP basics.</p>
<p>Going to fix this, and study like a beginner üëç <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NeverNotWorking?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NeverNotWorking</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Robert DeVore (@deviorobert) <a href="https://twitter.com/deviorobert/status/976496147777847296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 21, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Sure, I&#8217;ve learned a lot of PHP over the years, along with a handful of other languages, but the learning has been fractured at best.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never taken a course, read any developer-related books, or done much more than Google searches, skimming blog posts and hacking together code until it worked.</p>
<p>I really feel like I&#8217;m missing out on my full potential as a developer by not learning the basics of¬† the languages I write in.</p>
<h2>So, what am I gonna do about it?</h2>
<p>For starters, I&#8217;m writing this blog post and making a public declaration that I&#8217;m <em>actually</em> going to do something about it ?</p>
<p>While I continue working on the release of WP Dispensary v2.0 (which is less than a week away as I type this), I will continue <em><strong>&#8220;learning on the job&#8221;</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I will also be taking the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PHP course</a> at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codecademy</a>.</p>
<p>Over 900 thousand others have taken the course, and it says it&#8217;s only about 4 hours from start to finish, so I feel like it&#8217;ll give me a solid &#8211; and quick &#8211; overview of PHP.</p>
<p>This video also gives a nice, brief run down of PHP, so I plan on watching this a couple of times while working on projects.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Learn PHP in 15 minutes" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdP0KM49IVk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Because I want to continue making <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WP Dispensary</a> better, and offering full Gutenberg support when WordPress switches editors, I plan on also learning JavaScript basics.</p>
<p>One of the first things I&#8217;ll be doing is watching this video, which has over 1 million views and packs a lot of the basics of JavaScript into such a short video.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Learn JavaScript in 12 Minutes" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ukg_U3CnJWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been looking into a couple of courses, like the <a href="https://javascriptforwp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript for WordPress</a> course from <a href="https://twitter.com/zgordon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zac Gordon</a>.</p>
<p>This is really going to be a life long journey, but I&#8217;m really happy to be jumping off the edge at this point in my life and (hopefully) learning to fly on the way down ?</p>
