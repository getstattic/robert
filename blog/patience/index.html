        <p>The concept of not getting what I want right now, without having to wait, has been completely lost on me. I&#8217;m eager for the results, and a lot of the time, I lose any patience that&#8217;s required in order to get the results I want.</p>
<p><em>I blame it on my childhood.</em></p>
<p>Not because I was handed anything with a silver spoon, because anybody who knows me can tell you that my childhood was the exact opposite of that.</p>
<p>But what I did have as a child, and still do as an adult, is the ability to quickly pick things up and learn them. I participated in sports growing up, drew, wrote poetry and worked on computers.</p>
<p>No matter what I did, I learned quickly.</p>
<p>The bad thing is that this has bled over into my work life as an adult.<!--more--></p>
<p>I can pick up a new piece of software, or technical skills needed to complete a task, like learning about API&#8217;s when building the <a href="http://robertdevore.com/leafly-reviews-wordpress-plugin/">Leafly Reviews plugin</a> or releasing <a href="http://www.wpdispensary.com/wp-dispensary-version-1-1/" target="_blank">version 1.1</a> of the <a href="http://robertdevore.com/wp-dispensary/">WP Dispensary plugin</a> with API integration.</p>
<p>The time it takes for me to catch on is low, so I tend to look at everything in my life the same way.</p>
<p>If I <strong>can&#8217;t</strong> pick it up and learn it quickly, I get frustrated and move on.</p>
<p>If I <strong>can</strong> pick it up and learn it quickly, I get bored and move on.</p>
<p>Learning how to manage this has been rough, but it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m growing into every day.</p>
<h2>Expecting the unexpected</h2>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ve done to start exercising my strength when needing to have patience in situations is to expect the unexpected.</p>
<p>As a developer, I&#8217;ve had more than my share of hours wasted looking for a missing semicolon in my code; <em>I&#8217;m sure we all have</em>.</p>
<p>When I used to start projects, I would sit down and tell myself that it will be done quick and everything will go smooth from start to finish.</p>
<p>Experience has taught me that is complete bullshit and I have since started to expect things to go wrong during the process.</p>
<p>The results?</p>
<p>I start a project knowing that something will jump up and smack me in the face, but I&#8217;m comfortable with that.</p>
<p>If it does end up happening (it does, more often than not), I&#8217;ve followed the advice of Paulo Coelho and respect the process, finish strong and keep moving forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have seen many storms in my life. Most storms have caught me by surprise, so I had to learn very quickly to look further and understand that I am not capable of controlling the weather, to exercise the art of patience and to respect the fury of nature.&#8221; &#8211; <cite>Paulo Coelho</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Letting go of the things I cannot control, and putting complete <a href="http://robertdevore.com/focus/">focus</a> on the things I can control has been a blessing.</p>
<h2>Finding success in patience</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard the <em>&#8220;nothing happens overnight&#8221;</em> statements, and see the debunking of the <em>&#8220;overnight success&#8221;</em> that in reality took years to accomplish.</p>
<p>The one thing I&#8217;ve learned while working on having more patience in my life is that it is an absolute requirement for long term success.</p>
<p>You can go viral, get a bunch of sales in, and then fall off the face of the planet a week later if you&#8217;re not prepared for the long haul.</p>
<p>Is that success? Sure, short term success is still success.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m more focused on long term success and building a business that I can be proud of, sustains my way of life and can help others in the process.</p>
<p>For this to happen, I need to remain focused, have patience and determination in order to succeed.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success.&#8221; &#8211; <cite>Napoleon Hill</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that mixing the patience required to succeed, with the right amount of hustle is a winning combination.</p>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>
