            <p>It&#8217;s taken me three tries to sit here and begin writing this blog post. I&#8217;ve put so much of myself into my work these last six months that I am feeling something unique to me; pride in myself and my work.</p>
<p>Over the last few years I&#8217;ve been living off of the income generated from various websites I was running, but I never felt connected to the work. It was always just what helped me survive, and I lost interest in it.</p>
<p>On my birthday last year I made a promise to myself that I&#8217;ll be moving forward in a new direction, giving back to the open source community that helped me survive and provide a somewhat decent life over the last decade.<!--more--></p>
<h2>#opensource saved my life</h2>
<p>I began working on how I would go about doing something that I was happy with and give back, thinking through the various angles I could take.</p>
<p>First, I thought about blogging to give advice on how to build sites you can make money from. But that didn&#8217;t feel right.</p>
<p>The thought of writing about something I was no longer interested quickly made me realize I had to jump in a different direction.</p>
<p>So instead of any clear plan, I released the Clean Blog WordPress theme on August 7th 2015, and at that point there was no going back.</p>
<p>That pretty much sums up my life though, flying with my eyes closed and never having taken a flight lesson before.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll figure it out when I get there ðŸ™‚</p>
<h2>Why WordPress?</h2>
<p>I run pretty much all of the sites I&#8217;ve built over the last decade on WordPress.</p>
<p>So it was only natural that I&#8217;d look at extra ways of working within the WordPress community. The same community that saved me, even if they didn&#8217;t know it.</p>
<p>After releasing the <a href="http://robertdevore.com/clean-blog-free-wordpress-theme/" target="_blank">Clean Blog</a> theme, it was like a breathe of fresh air hit me and I was ready to take on the world.</p>
<p>But again, I didn&#8217;t know where I going exactly, so I just kept plugging away at life.</p>
<p>There was the <a href="http://robertdevore.com/mnml-free-minimalist-wordpress-theme/" target="_blank">MNML</a> theme release, <a href="http://robertdevore.com/peddle-free-wordpress-theme-for-easy-digital-downloads/" target="_blank">Peddle</a>, which is a WordPress theme that works with Easy Digital Downloads and a <a href="https://github.com/deviodigital/landingpage-realestate" target="_blank">couple of bootstrap</a> <a href="https://github.com/deviodigital/landingpage-squeeze-page" target="_blank">landing page templates</a>.</p>
<p>I released the <a href="http://robertdevore.com/leafly-reviews-wordpress-plugin/">Leafly Reviews</a> WordPress plugin as an attempt to help the cannabis community build better websites, and integrate their Leafly reviews directly on their own sites.</p>
<p>Giving the power back to the independent business owner was my driving force when I began and it still is.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why after I built the Leafly Reviews plugin I created and released the <a href="http://www.wpdispensary.com" target="_blank">WP Dispensary</a> menu management plugin for WordPress for free.</p>
<p>After 6 version releases since it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wpdispensary.com/welcome-to-wp-dispensary/" target="_blank">initial launch</a>, the WP Dispensary plugin has pushed me farther than I had thought I&#8217;d ever go &#8230; and it&#8217;s only been six months since it&#8217;s first release.</p>
<h2>Where Devio Digital comes into play</h2>
<p>First some backstory.</p>
<p>I created the name Devio Digital because the word Devio (<em>dev-E-oh</em>) is a combination of two last names that mean a lot to me. So no matter what, those names are now connected forever through the name of the company.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a unique word that I hope will help set me apart from more generic names, like Envato and Google have done with their names.</p>
<p>As WP Dispensary has grown, and now has additional <a href="http://www.wpdispensary.com/add-ons" target="_blank">add-ons</a> and themes being built for it, I felt the urge to jump in and help dispensary owners learn the power behind owning and operating their own website.</p>
<p>Leafly cut it&#8217;s API off and stopped the Leafly Reviews plugin from being functional, as well as various other projects that developers were building to help the Leafly ecosystem grow.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s to say they won&#8217;t cut you off in other ways as well?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen it happen before when free hosted solutions completely shut down in the past, and when Blogger removes blogs because Google doesn&#8217;t like them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are more specific reasons than <em>&#8216;I don&#8217;t like your blog&#8217;</em>, but it&#8217;s still their website you&#8217;re using for free and they reserve the right to cancel you at any time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same thing as relying on Instagram as your only source of online communication with your patients, and Instagram closes your account down for some random flagged violation.</p>
<p>Why leave the power of your business&#8217; professional online presence to rest in the hands of a company that&#8217;s not your own?</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.deviodigital.com" target="_blank">Devio Digital</a></strong> is my attempt to not only earn a living from the work I am doing, but also to help dispensary owners build solid businesses and elegantly display your menu for your patients.</p>
<h2>What can I do for you?</h2>
<p>If your business is suffering from a bad website, or even if you don&#8217;t have one up currently, I am here and happy to help you push your business to the next level online.</p>
<p>The cannabis industry gets a bad wrap, and my goal is to help you present yourself professionally and help end the stigma around your business.</p>
<p>You can read more about my current offerings on the <a href="http://www.deviodigital.com" target="_blank">Devio Digital</a> website.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my blog posts here.</p>
<p>I know your time is valuable, and I respect that.</p>
<p>Hopefully you find the things I write and build to be worth it.</p>
