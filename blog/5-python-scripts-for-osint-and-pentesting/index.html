        <p>Everything is insecure and you&#8217;re one bad decision away from being p0wn3d harder than you ever have in your entire life.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="480" height="270" src="https://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/giphy-1230.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-9120"/></figure>

<p>It&#8217;s a harsh reality and one you&#8217;ve got to accept in full or ignore altogether.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m from the group that believes we can fix <em>some</em> of the things that are broken, even if only <em>slightly</em> making things better.</p>

<p>So I started doing what I do best: write code.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Learning Python</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a few reasons to start learning Python, from my interest in Machine Learning and LLMs to pentesting, red teaming, and hacking in general.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to build a calculator, todo app, or snake game.</p>

<p>So instead of just reading books and doing a bunch of tasks I wouldn&#8217;t be interested in, I jumped head first into hacking scripts.</p>

<p>I dissected a bunch, searched Google, asked ChatGPT questions and eventually cobbled together some scripts that I&#8217;m finding useful as I focus more on security for myself and others.</p>

<p>This post showcases a few scripts that I&#8217;ve built which could be useful for more people than just me, and I want to share them with you.</p>

<p>Feel free to download, alter and use these codes however you see fit.</p>

<p>Open Source FTW ðŸ¤˜ðŸ’¯</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Combine TXT files</h2>

<p>When you&#8217;re downloading multiple TXT files full of potential passwords or other data, there&#8217;s gonna come a time when you need to combine them into one easy to manage file.</p>

<p>I mean, if you&#8217;re building a password cracker (more on that below), you&#8217;re not really gonna want to run the same cracker script on dozens of files separately.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where the <a href="https://github.com/robertdevore/pypractice/tree/main/combine-txt">combine-txt</a> script comes in ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<p>Run this script in a folder with multiple&nbsp;<code>txt</code>&nbsp;files and it will combine them all, remove duplicates and save the updated list to a new&nbsp;<code>txt</code>&nbsp;file.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="432" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/combine-txt-python-script-example.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-8815"/></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Email Scraper</h2>

<p>When doing recon on a website, you&#8217;ll inevitably start gathering as much personal info about the target as possible, including any email address you can find.</p>

<p>So of course I had to create a custom script that would scan domains for any email addresses within the content </p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/robertdevore/pypractice/tree/main/email-scraper">email-scraper</a> script will take a domain name and searches the site for any email addresses, and then stores them in a newly created <code>txt</code> file for your review.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Password Cracker(s)</h2>

<p>For the times when you are able to gain access to a database of user logins, you can take the hashes you find and try to crack them.</p>

<p>In order to not be a script kiddie (eww, who wants that?), I created a couple of password crackers.</p>

<p>The first one, <a href="https://github.com/robertdevore/pypractice/tree/main/password-cracker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">password-cracker</a>, is a more basic cracker that accepts an md5 hash and runs it against <code>txt</code> files to try and find a match.</p>

<p>The second one, <a href="https://github.com/robertdevore/pypractice/tree/main/password-cracker-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">password-cracker-2</a>, is more robust and one that I plan to continue working on. </p>

<p>That one allows you to provide a hash and also choose which hash you&#8217;re trying to crack (md5, sha1, sha512, etc).</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="432" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/password-cracker-python-script-example.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-8813"/></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Regex Scanner</h2>

<p>For the times when scanning through a WordPress site for potential vulnerabilities seems like a daunting task, this script should help speed up that process.</p>

<p>I created the <a href="https://github.com/robertdevore/pypractice/tree/main/regex-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regex-scanner</a> script to help automate the process of searching through theme/plugin/core files in a WordPress site. </p>

<p>The original goal was to find certain types of code that are typically found when a site is hacked.</p>

<p>Things like: <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.eval.php" rel="nofollow">eval</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fopen.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fopen</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">file_get_contents</a>, <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.extract.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">extract</a>, etc are searched for, but I also added in some outdated PHP code like <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.create-function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">create_function</a> in order to help with PHP compatibility testing.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="228" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/regex-scanner-python-script-example.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-8811"/></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">XSS Scanner</h2>

<p>Continuing with the vulnerability scanning scripts, I decided to build out a suite of scanners for things like XSS, CSRF, etc.</p>

<p>First up was XSS, since it&#8217;s one of the lowest-hanging fruit.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/robertdevore/pypractice/tree/main/xss-yes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">xss-yes</a> script accepts an XML file URL and then scans every URL found inside of it for an XSS vulnerability.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="432" src="http://robertdevore.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/xss-scanner-python-script-example.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-8812"/></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s next?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m working on building more tools and will continue to release open-source security scripts.</p>

<p>I would like to eventually package a handful of these scripts into one giant tool that can run all of these together, instead of having a ton of individual scripts.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll get there eventually but for now, more baby steps ðŸ˜Ž </p>
