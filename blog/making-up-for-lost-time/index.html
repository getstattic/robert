        <p>Growing pains are a part of everyone&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>From the time you&#8217;re little and you wake up in the middle of the night with leg cramps because you&#8217;re getting taller, to the time you have to bite your tongue when someone makes an offhand remark you don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>Change is inevitable. Personal growth is a choice.</p>
<p>Being scared of change is normal, but we all have to move past those fears in order to grow personally and professionally.</p>
<p>Over the last few years I&#8217;ve had to do a lot of soul searching in order to find my direction going forward in life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a rough process.</p>
<p>At times I definitely wanted to give up; but I never did.</p>
<p>Instead, I used my past mistakes and failures to build a road map that I would follow moving forward.</p>
<p>The first step to finding the inner peace I&#8217;ve been searching for is learning how to let go of things I no longer have control over, things that I have done in my past, and the mistakes I&#8217;ve made.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Learning to let go</h2>
<p>As I write this, there&#8217;s one thing that sticks out in my head that I have yet to fully let go of.</p>
<p>I struggle to even talk about it, and am erasing and rewriting this blog post over and over again, trying to find the right words.</p>
<p>Learning to let go of something that&#8217;s out of your control is hard. Learning to let go of past relationships you are no longer a part of is hard. Learning how to let go of people, places and things you&#8217;re attached to is hard.</p>
<p>However, spending your entire life holding onto things that are hurting you is going to do you more harm than good.</p>
<p>Learning that is the hardest lesson of all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of ups and downs throughout my life, both personally and professionally. I&#8217;ve had my fair share of trouble, and done my fair share of good deeds.</p>
<p>My hope is that they&#8217;ve balanced each other out somehow, and the karma gods are smiling down on me.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a time in my life where I would have let my emotions get the best of me, and done things that I undoubtedly today would have regretted tremendously.</p>
<p>A situation I had no control over threw me for a loop, and caused a lot of chaos in my life.</p>
<p>I spent years trying to sort through the mess of pain, emotions and information I had about it, but all it did was weigh me down and slow up the progress I wanted so desperately in my life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was it something I caused? <strong>No.</strong></li>
<li>Was it in my hands to fix? <strong>No.</strong></li>
<li>Was it going to benefit my life if I spent the next 20 years trying to figure out all of the pieces to the puzzle? <strong>Absolutely not.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Learning how to let go of the anger, resentment and frustration that embodied me for years was rough. I&#8217;m still not fully <em>over it</em>, but I&#8217;ve learned how to manage my emotions better and try to find a peaceful resolution for the problem.</p>
<p>The jury is still out on if it&#8217;s going to work yet, since this is all still ongoing, but I have high hopes that it&#8217;ll all turn out for the best.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all we can hope for, right? Peaceful resolutions to past problems.</p>
<h2>Forgiving your past</h2>
<p>When it comes to things in my life that I&#8217;ve personally been responsible for, I&#8217;ve made a bad habit out of beating myself up over my choices.</p>
<p>Some of them were great, like my relationship with the Mrs. On the other hand, some of them were completely horrible, like when I was a teenager, got drunk then passed out in a retail store&#8217;s bathroom and was woken up by cops at gunpoint (long story).</p>
<ul>
<li>Am I ashamed of my past? <strong>No.</strong></li>
<li>Am I proud of everything I&#8217;ve done in my life? <strong>No.</strong></li>
<li>Am I learning how to forgive myself for the mistakes I&#8217;ve made so that I can move forward a happier and more free person? <strong>Absolutely.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes I forget that we all have a past and not everything in it is pretty.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve isolated myself so much that the <em>regular world</em> feels foreign to me. I always feel like an outsider, no matter what circle I&#8217;m trying to be a part of.</p>
<p>Personal insecurities aside, a lot of it stems from the absolute horror I feel when thinking about things I&#8217;ve done, a lot of which I know that I will never speak about publicly.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the thing though, we all have a past and how you feel about yours will directly effect in your future. I spent years scared to move forward because of the fear that my past would come back to haunt me.</p>
<p>Now, I spend a lot less time worrying about that because I&#8217;ve realized that I am not the same person I was 10 years ago, 5 years ago, 1 year ago or even 1 day ago.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing so much time and energy on my past, I&#8217;ve worked a lot more on myself.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve become physically stronger, eat healthier foods, nurture the relationships I truly care about and am letting go of the mistakes I&#8217;ve made and the people from my past that I have no desire to continue talking to.</p>
<p><strong>Side note:</strong> If you were a part of my past and I&#8217;m still actively trying to connect with you, it&#8217;s because I care. If I didn&#8217;t, you would have been cut off already.</p>
<p>So if I&#8217;m learning to let go and forgive my past, what&#8217;s next?</p>
<h2>Moving forward</h2>
<p>I spent far too much time standing still. I think a lot about the things I could have been doing had I not stopped building businesses like I was a decade ago.</p>
<p>Now, instead of focusing so much on what could have been, I am relying on my strengths and my ability to build businesses in order to continue forward with a life I can be proud of.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get angry when thinking about people or situations from my past, but those times are a lot less frequent now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m learning to look at things in a different light now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking all of those mistakes and horrible situations, bundling them together into one giant list of life lessons and ensuring that I apply that knowledge to my future endeavors.</p>
<h2>The road ahead</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve said all of that to say this: Nobody is perfect, not you and definitely not me. When I realized that, things became a lot more clear about the direction I wanted to go in with my life.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this post has given you something to think about and has helped you, even if it&#8217;s in a small, unnoticeable way.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do no harm, but take no shit.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure where I first seen that quote, but it&#8217;s stuck with me and I&#8217;m making it a central part of my life moving forward.</p>
<p>Do good, help people where you can and understand that even if you&#8217;ve done something wrong in your past, that doesn&#8217;t dictate your entire future.</p>
<p>The future is what we make it. Let&#8217;s make it awesome, together!</p>
