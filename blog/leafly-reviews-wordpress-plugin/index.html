            <p>You know those moments in your life where you step back and look around, knowing that things are about to change?</p>
<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m having one of those moments right now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve wrote a lot of code in my lifetime and customized other WordPress plugins in the past, but today marks a special moment in history, for me at least, because I am officially releasing my first WordPress plugin.</p>
<h2>Leafly Reviews WordPress plugin</h2>
<p>As a dispensary owner, or developer who works with marijuana dispensaries, you&#8217;ve undoubtedly heard of the Leafly website before.</p>
<p>Odds are very high that a dispensary worth anything has a profile on Leafly and is getting reviews from patients.</p>
<p>Until today, there was not an easy way to showcase those reviews on your own website. That&#8217;s all about to change.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>Introducing Leafly Reviews for WordPress!</strong></p>
<p>This free WordPress plugin gives you a way to easily display your dispensary reviews from Leafly on your own website through the use of a widget or shortcode.</p>
<h3>Download</h3>
<p>I&#8217;d suggest reading the entire post, but if you just can&#8217;t wait to get your hands on the plugin, you can <a href="#download">click here</a> to be taken to the bottom of the post with the download links.</p>
<h3>Adding your APP ID and KEY</h3>
<p>Once you install this plugin, you&#8217;ll notice a new options page in your WordPress dashboard under the Settings section, titled &#8220;Leafly Reviews&#8221;.</p>
<p>On this page, you&#8217;ll be able to add in your APP ID and KEY, which is needed for the plugin to work.</p>
<p>Not sure where to get your APP ID and KEY?</p>
<p>You get them from the <a href="http://developer.leafly.com/" target="_blank">Leafly Developer</a> area, which lets you sign up for an account and create an app.</p>
<p>When you create the app, you&#8217;ll be given a KEY and ID to use, which is what you&#8217;ll need to copy over to this plugin&#8217;s settings page.</p>
<p><strong>Caching built in</strong></p>
<p>Leafly gives their API users a limit of 25 hits per day for their <strong>seed</strong> account, or 60 hits per minute for their <strong>bloom</strong> account.</p>
<p>To help your dispensary utilize this plugin without needing to upgrade to bloom, and taking too many hits to your account, I&#8217;ve built in a cache that refreshes once per hour.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing that you need to do on your end in order to get this to work, it&#8217;s baked right in to the plugin &#8211; pardon the pun ðŸ™‚</p>
<h3>Widget Options</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/images/leafly-reviews-wordpress-plugin-widget.webp" alt="leafly-reviews-wordpress-plugin-widget" width="312" height="487" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-150" />After you install the Leafly Reviews WordPress plugin, you&#8217;ll be able to add a custom widget to your website&#8217;s sidebar (or anywhere else that widgets are enabled in your theme).</p>
<p>The widget is colored green, so you&#8217;ll be able to easily spot it on your widgets page. Drag it into place where ever you&#8217;d like it to show, and fill in the options, which you can see to the left.</p>
<p>Here, you can add in your dispensaries URL slug and the amount of reviews you&#8217;d like to show (limit: 100). </p>
<p>You can also select if you want to show the reviewer&#8217;s avatar, the star rating, individual ratings for meds, service and atmosphere, if the user reviewer would recommend your dispensary and shop there again, and also show the reviewers comments.</p>
<h3>Shortcode Options</h3>
<p>A secondary option built into the plugin to display your reviews from Leafly is the shortcode. Sometimes, it might be a better option to show reviews on a page of your website (for instance, the home page), so the shortcode will give you all of the flexibility you need.</p>
<p>Here is the basic shortcode:</p>
<p><code>[leaflyreviews slug="denver-relief"]</code></p>
<p>You will need to add in your slug, just like the widget options. The shortcode will default to showing 5 reviews, and all of the options given in the widget (avatar, star rating, detailed rating, recommendation, shop again and comments.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to remove some of these options from showing, you can add the option to the shortcode with the value of <em>no</em>, like this:</p>
<p><code>[leaflyreviews slug="denver-relief" limit="5" avatar="no" stars="no" ratings="no" recommend="no" shopagain="no" comments="no"]</code></p>
<h2>Credits &amp; Thank-you&#8217;s</h2>
<p>Without the open source projects below, this plugin would have never came together the way that it has. I&#8217;d like to say thank you to everyone who was indirectly a part of this WordPress plugin&#8217;s release.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p><strong>Leafly closed it&#8217;s API, so as of 2.29.16, this plugin no longer works.</strong></p>
<p>I will be keeping an eye out if an API ever opens back up and I can update this plugin.</p>
<p>Still want to check the plugin out anyways?</p>
<p>You can download the Leafly Reviews WordPress plugin via the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/leafly-reviews/" target="_blank">official WordPress plugin repository</a>.</p>
<p>You can also download it directly from your WordPress dashboard by going to <code>Plugins - Add New</code> and searching for <strong>Leafly Reviews</strong>.</p>
<h2>The road ahead</h2>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this entire release post.</p>
<p>Right now, the plugin is going to sit while it gets tested out by various dispensaries in order to find any bugs that need fixed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also got plans in the future to add an option for the user to select the amount of time that passes before the cache refreshes itself, as well as a couple of other enhancements.</p>
<p>Want to contribute to the plugin? Head over to the <a href="http://github.com/deviodigital/leafly-reviews-wordpress-plugin" target="_blank">Github repository</a> and submit any issues you find or pull requests. Your contributions are both welcomed and appreciated.</p>
