        <p>Within the last few months I have been developing this plugin from the ground up. I've ensured that when the product was released, there would be a great use for it, and a demand for more solutions like it.
With a market that is <a href="http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881">29 states strong</a> right now, and more states positioned to legalize medical marijuana as well as recreational marijuana over the next 5-10 years, I want to cater to this growing industry and provide the professional websites that dispensary owners deserve.

<h2>Professional dispensary websites.</h2>
<p>The goal of the WP Dispensary plugin is to give a dispensary owner the ability to add and edit their menu of products with ease, directly from their WordPress dashboard.
Mission accomplished!</p>
<h3>Introducing WP Dispensary</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.wpdispensary.com/"><img alt="wpdispensary-logo-updated" src="/images/wpdispensary-logo-updated.webp" /></a>
<strong><a href="http://www.wpdispensary.com/">WP Dispensary</a></strong> was built with ease of use in mind, so the setup process of the plugin is as simple as adding and activating the plugin, adding your content and sitting back to bask in the glory of how easy it was to set up.
There's also a lot of cool things baked right into the WP Dispensary menu plugin.
Easy to manage menu, complete control over menu item details, your content is exportable, and is 100% Open Source.
WP Dispensary is free to use with no license restrictions or expensive setup fees. It's as simple as downloading the plugin, installing it on your WordPress powered website, and adding content.</p>
<h3>Installation is a breeze</h3>
<p>Set up WP Dispensary in a single click right from your dashboard. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dispensary/">WP Dispensary</a> plugin is hosted in the official WordPress plugin repository.

Once you have the plugin installed, you'll need an easy way to display your menu, and that's where the <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/cannabiz">CannaBiz</a> WordPress theme comes into play.
I personally crafted a WordPress theme that is fully integrated with the WP Dispensary plugin, giving you a website that showcases your menu in the most beautiful way possible.

<h3>REST API Integration</h3>
<p>One of the items on the development list for this plugin from the moment I released it in November of last year was REST API integration.
As of <em>version 1.1</em> , <strong>WP Dispensary</strong> comes fully integrated into the REST API, giving developers the ability to pull data from the custom post types and showcase them with Javascript, on the web or within an app.</p>
<h3>Example API usage</h3>
<p>Below is a quick and dirty gist of showcasing content from your menu.

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>You can download the WP Dispensary WordPress plugin via the <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dispensary/">WordPress plugin directory</a>.
You can also download it in your WordPress dashboard by going to <code>Plugins - Add New</code> and searching for <strong>WP Dispensary</strong>.</p>
<h3>Want to contribute to the plugin?</h3>
